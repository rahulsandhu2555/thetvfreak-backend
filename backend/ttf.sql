He always makes a movie that is more than cinema life like you can\'t even compare it.</p>\r\n<p>After watching this movie most of the people say that it is a zero logic movie or this is the movie that they have watched when they were a kid. Basically, the plot of the movie was like 18 or 19 centuries.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Some people are comparing this movie with Bihari movies in which you have seen a lot of a stunt or we can see a lot of illogical stunts. Some of the audience are saying that this film doesn\'t have even a story.</p>\r\n<p>Milap Zaveri tried to make a movie with lots of stunts, action, and thrillers but by mistake, he made a Bihari movie. But unfortunately, the time of Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan\'s movies has passed now.</p>\r\n<p>Everybody watches a movie because of its direction, acting, logical thing, and story but almost everything was missing in this film according to reviews on different portals.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>***There are some dialogues in the movie you won\'t able to listen to them. There is a dialogue When Sidharth Malhotra who is playing the character of Hero Raghu shows himself the first time in the film is having a first aid kid in his hand and he says</p>\r\n<p><br />\"<em>Main todunga bhi aur tod kar jodunga bhi\"</em>. <br />What is this, this is hilarious. And here another one comes <br />\"<em>Main marunga mar jaega, dobara janam lene se dar jaega</em>\". <br /><em>“Main badla nahin, inteqam loonga Zoya. Inteqam.”</em></p>\r\n<p><br />We bet you can justify Marjaavan film by these two dialogues only, this movie may be a good hit if the action came with logic and conviction to match.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>Marjaavaan Review by KRK</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:html -->\r\n<p>[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA5K5-86Cck[/embedyt]</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:html -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>Watch Trailer of Marjaavaan</h2>\r\n<p>[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7TbPUOn1hc[/embedyt]</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Marjaavaan is an action <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-romantic-comedies-that-are-forever-in-our-hearts/\">romantic film</a>, releasing on 15 Nov.

For decades Hollywood has produced numbers of sequels of successful movies. Sometimes winning praise and accolades, sometimes showering the audience with sheer disappointment. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not easy to pick a handful from this vast wilderness of motion pictures. Here we’ve selected the top ten. This selection is in accordance with a cult fan base. Each of these films introduced a whole new genre in the history of Hollywood.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>10. Fast &amp; Furious Hollywood Movie:</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1119 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fast-and-furious-min.jpg\" alt=\"Fast and furious trilogy\" width=\"500\" height=\"360\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This action-thriller franchise is the first of its kind. It brings the ultra-tech speed directly from Nascar track to box office. Even the most powerful performance by veteran <strong>Vin Diesel</strong> doesn’t bring him at the top of the cast list as that place is filled by the 1970 Dodge Charger R/T driven by Dominic Toretto. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although losing <strong>Paul Walker</strong> in the middle of producing Furious 7 came as a huge shock. This franchise is still successfully continuing by adopting stars like Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron successfully in the storyline.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1123 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fast-and-furious2-min.jpg\" alt=\"Fast and furious- Hollywood\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\r\n<h3>Watch Latest Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMKRevYa_M[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>9.</strong><strong>Amer</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>c</strong></span><strong>an Pie Hollywood Franchises</strong>:</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Pie is always a cult choice. This franchise will always give you this bizarre confusion about whether to take it as serious sex education or just teen fun. The subject topic is not entirely new, we can always thank “The Graduate” for that. With the most robust expression of boyhood turning in manhood with naughty adventures, everyone fantasizes about it in adolescence and become nostalgic in the old days.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This franchise successfully first installed the long line of popular teen movie culture which is now a proven entertainment medium.</span>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Watch Latest Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kTFf9qOwQ[/embedyt]\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\r\n<h2><strong>8.

Largely thanks to Steven Spielberg for the unique conceptual development and a clear scientific explanation to back up the storyline. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the series saw a decline when Spielberg left the franchise and the general audience almost saw the end of it, surprisingly saw the revival with changing the name to Jurassic World in 2015 and since then successfully carrying on with a worldwide appeal.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1126 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Jurassic-world-movie-min.jpg\" alt=\"Jurassic world\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjIaV6CU0wA[/embedyt]\r\n<h3>Watch Latest Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJJrkyHas78[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>7.

None I bet. Until Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan got an already dead and mummified superhero with a hideous reputation in the box office (watch Batman Forever or Batman &amp; Robin if you dare) team up with Christian Bale, yet to prove himself up to that point to be a cent percent action hero and finally add up the special ingredient by introducing Heath Ledger in the role of Joker and boom, you got Dark Knight, the superhero is saved finally and with what continuity! Yet you may complain about the sudden end of the series after three installations, well, why so serious? After all, this is Batman.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1131 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-dark-night-riese-min.jpg\" alt=\"the dark night\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1133 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-dark-night-min.jpg\" alt=\"the dark night\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXeTwQWrcwY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>6.

Name is Bond, James Bond, who is the ultimate Casanova with his charismatic and slick appearance. After the end of the cold war, this character could die from losing its purpose. Even the later part of Pierce Brosnan saw some mortification. The franchise still survives adopting contemporary political reality and rationalism.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36mnx8dBbGE[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>5.

Which revolver around aliens and monsters earlier. Followed by a number of brilliant later attempts like Mr. Nobody or The Inception to revoke the theory of the presence of only one factual world that we live in.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKQi3bBA1y8[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>4.

This franchise soon captured everyone’s imagination with vivid picturization of the far future galaxy and its divergent civilizations. It takes a typical war action movie genre to a galactic level with extensive visualization. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though sometimes hard to follow as the original story was released in the late ’70s, prequels in the late ’90s, and the sequels during the last couple of years, but still very enjoyable because of the thrill and drama every segment presents. And as our reach slowly but steadily expending to the outer edges of the solar system, this franchise is now more rational than ever.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1129 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/star-wars-movies-min.jpg\" alt=\"star wars trilogy movies\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>3.

A superb franchise with captivating music, punk action, phony dialogues all steaming up to a spicy combination. It will forever be marked as American classics.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X2DtiE7VLw[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>2.The Godfather Hollywood Movie:</strong><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1135 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-godfather-trilogy-min.jpg\" alt=\"the godfather trilogy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" /></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguably this is the only movie on the list that actually overcame the perception of its source literature, considering there is still a number one to be announced. It’s a rare combination, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert De Nero all in a Francisco Ford Coppola movie and they all manage to give their best!. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And most ironically, this franchise successfully immortalizes the Sicilian Mafioso culture as a social nobility. With all its bloodshed and corruption. A real classic cult drama, which can always be revisited.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1134 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-godfather-trilogy-quotos-min.jpg\" alt=\"the godfather trilogy Hollywood Franchises\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer GF 1:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY1S34973zA[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer GF 2:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O1Iy9od7-A[/embedyt]\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer GF 1:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQQyM43P6y0[/embedyt]\r\n<div align=\"justify\">\r\n<h2><strong>1.The Lord of the Rings:</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1136 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-lord-of-the-rings-min.jpg\" alt=\"the godfather trilogy Hollywood Franchises\" width=\"682\" height=\"576\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Jackson with his Lord of the Rings proves that epics can not only be found in parchments but also can be written on celluloid. This adaptation is on J. R. R. Tolkien’s famous novel series of the same name. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This series takes us to the fictional world of middle earth on an epic journey with men, elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls, and many other magnificent creatures. It’s like visualizing a whole new world with a whole new history. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book is vividly picturized. Tolkien even invented a whole new alphabet to put on the elvish tongue. The success of Peter Jackson is in the true to life adaptation and graphic presentation with grand settings and following the exact mood of the storyline.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With fine editing, he manages to compact the epic story in three parts, although it should be count as one single plot, and later narrates the journey of Bilbo Baggins in “The Hobbit” in another three parts. The audience still awaits more similar production from the team as still there is a lot of middle earth remains to be put on motion pictures.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1127 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lord-of-the-rings-q-min.jpg\" alt=\"the godfather trilogy Hollywood Franchises\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1128 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lord-of-the-rings-min.jpg\" alt=\"the godfather trilogy\" width=\"658\" height=\"552\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this list, we tried to incorporate all pioneers of a new genre in the vast world of Hollywood entertainment.

In this series Paatal Lok the director perfectly captured the wickedness of the capital city of Delhi like it shows the lush beauty of its NDMC avenues, the rustic charm of the government quarters, and the unspoken agreement that the area near Yamuna river is generally out of bounds.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Story Review of Paatal Lok:</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1204 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paatal-lok-abkishek.jpg\" alt=\"paatal lok\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four Suspects are hired for a conspiracy to murder. Their target is to murder a very famous and reputed news anchor at a Delhi National channel. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The character of news anchor Sanjeev Mehra is also interesting and Neeraj Kabi played the role very well. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the outer Jamuna Paar police outpost, much to the chagrin of his Senior officer, Hathi Ram Chaudhary, the role was played by the versatile actor Jaideep Ahlawat, who is assigned the high profile case.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Episodes of Paatal Lok:</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This series has nine episodes, the story unfolds the two-levels of our society like the upper class and middle class. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the first one shows the elite upper-class Delhi News anchor\'s world whose life deals with an anxiety-ridden and dog-loving wife. Her name is Dolly. Dolly is a Bengali girl and Bengali actress Swastika Mukherjee played this role. The character Sanjeev Mehra also deals with some power play of a newsroom. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another side that shows the middle-class Delhi family life where people faced many problems to lead their everyday life. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hathi Ram is a police officer but in his career, he did not get the proper o</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pportunity in his workplace that proves his potentiality in his work. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hathi Ram doesn\'t catch a break, in his personal or professional life, but he earned the respect for his family and for his son. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though it is very slow starting from the second episode the series actually began. There are a lot of characters in this web series but the two characters attract audience attraction with their acting ability. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These two characters are Abhishek Banerjee who played the serial killer Vishal Tyagi or Hathora Tyagi in this series. And the other is Jaideep Ahlawat. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once silent acting astonished the audience and other acting abilities. This made him given the praise to be a versatile actor. </span>\r\n<h2><strong>Jaideep Ahlawat, Character Hathi Ram Chaudhary:</strong></h2>\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vtbU2qJ_a3s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this series, we saw different shades of Hathi Ram Chaudhary. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As if we saw that he is having an exasperated character, tender with his wife and also very supportive but in case of his son. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He is very unsure as a father with a rebellious teenage son and he became desperate to get the high-profile case that will help me to restore some respects and pride of his son\'s eyes. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other Shades that his character Hathi Ram Chaudhary shows is his pairing with Ansari. It showed the senior-junior bond. It showed that an experienced senior officer helped his junior how to solve a case. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But they also shared some good emotional bonding with each other. Ansari helped his seniors in every way until the end. Through the Ansari Character, the director showed the religious discrimination of our country. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Ansari is a Muslim so he was facing discrimination and dislike in the police station. Apart from Hathi Ram, every senior officer in the department dislikes him</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This series showed every problem that our country faced on like caste discrimination, politics, and violence corruption and power play at all levels. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When inspector Hathiram begins his investigation about the Sanjeev Mehra\'s attempt to murder case that took him to the darkest side of the paatal Lok web series. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, though he discovered the actual truth for some upper-level power play he did not disclose the actual truth before the public. </span>\r\n<h2><strong>Abhishek Banerjee, A Most Interesting Character:</strong></h2>\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OlmRqB-c4S4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abhishek Banerjee played another important role in this web series. Vishal Tyagi or Hathoda Tyagi is the main antagonist of the story.

Tony Stark, which would be his true name then fought back to snap his own fingers at the end of Avengers: Endgame. But this snap resulted in him being taken away from everyone who loved him. Including us. </span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_anDMGmck-k[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Billionaire, Playboy, Genius, Philanthropist that he so confidently called himself, was one of the favourites for fans all over.

Will Iron Man return? Will Tony Stark return? All the fans all over are sitting fingers crossed hoping for a miracle for him to return. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read ahead to find out whether he would be returning to the MCU. And if so, in what manner would he be returning?</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Will Tony Stark be back?</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simple answer is yes. Tony Stark will return to the MCU in one way or another. Now it’s a question of how. There have been a variety of reports suggesting he would be returning for future Marvel movies. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way in which he could is with cameo appearances across the various movies that would be coming out. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving appearances in a manner similar to Nick Fury with flashbacks to previous unseen events that have taken place.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Tony Stark’s return confirmed?</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1364 \" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/the-Grandmaster-thor-rang-rock-min.jpg\" alt=\"the Grandmaster thor rang rock-min\" width=\"749\" height=\"486\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeff Goldblum, who plays the Grandmaster in Thor: Ragnarock recently confirmed via a Buzzfeed interview that Tony Stark would be returning in the Marvel ‘What if’ series. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This news came as a shock to many who did not expect his return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Especially, after his character in Avengers: Endgame sacrificed his life.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is “What if”?</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/whats-next-in-marvel-series-movies-and-release-date/\">There are lots of movies gonna come to MARVEL</a>. Marvel has confirmed a new Disney+ series called “What if” that would be a part of a series of shows that they are creating. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside ‘Wanda-Vision’ and ‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’, ‘What if’ will complete the original trio of shows announced. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show is said to be an animated universe of different and various possible scenarios that could have been different. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been confirmed that Robert Downey Jr. would be returning to give the voice over for the Iron Man character that would be featuring in that series.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1290 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-if..-2021-min.jpg\" alt=\"what if.. 2021\" width=\"575\" height=\"350\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeff Goldblum mentioned that he had played the character of Grandmaster once again recently. He had said that he had done so for an episode for the show ‘What if’. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He mentioned that it\'s an animated show comprising of all of our favourite characters and that the episode he mentioned consisted of the Grandmaster and Iron man as well. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘What if’ show is based on the Marvel Comic that is of the same name. The series will consist of each episode with a separate storyline based on an alternate reality in the universe.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Iron Man 4 in the works?</strong></h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-xMtOBSBAI[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robert Downey Jr. appeared on the Ellen show and Ellen immediately questioned about his return to the MCU. And whether there is another Iron Man movie in the works. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question came after several reports came out mentioning that Iron Man 4 is going to be a part of the next batch of movies.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deadline also questioned the star asking him about the rumour. The rumour had mentioned that he would only make another Iron Man movie only if Mel Gibson would direct the movie. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To which the actor responded positively. While it was taken on as some light-hearted talk from the start, it gave hope that he would be willing to return in the future.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Tony Stark may not but will Iron Man return?</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1366 \" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spiderman-as-iron-man-min.jpg\" alt=\"spiderman as iron man-min\" width=\"699\" height=\"393\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Spiderman: Far From Home, the entire premise revolved around who would take up the mantle of Iron Man after Tony Stark’s death. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A character of Iron Man’s power and ability needs to be present to inspire and help the world with the work that he does. The movies have teased the idea of the mantle of Iron Man being based on ahead to other characters. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tony’s best friend and army general ‘James Rhodes’ has a suit similar to his to be War Machine.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1368 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/James-Rhodes-as-iron-man-min.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"717\" height=\"466\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Avengers Endgame Pepper Potts, Tony’s wife also has a suit with the name ‘Rescue’ to be comic accurate. Endgame also teased his daughter wearing the ‘Rescue’ helmet as well. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tony removes off her head immediately. It could be taken as a hint as to her eventually taking up the mantle of Iron Man or maybe ‘Iron Woman’ as in her case in the eventual possible future.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1367 \" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pepper-potts-as-iron-man-min.jpg\" alt=\"pepper potts as iron man-min\" width=\"679\" height=\"382\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the funeral scene in Endgame, the presence of the kid ‘Harley Keener’ with whom Tony develops a bond during ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Man 3</a>’. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It could be a tease of the fact that he is going to be the next person to take up the mantle. Which would make sense, considering Tony nurtured his talent and helped him be the person he is.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1369 \" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/iron-man-3-min.jpg\" alt=\"iron man 3-min\" width=\"676\" height=\"380\" />\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what next for Iron Man?</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, there has been no official word as to the return neither Iron Man nor Tony Stark. We have to fell good with his return in ‘What if’ for the time being. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several possibilities with which either him or the mantle of Iron Man to return.

Also known as Captain America. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our favourite American Patriot has retired in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the conclusion in Avengers Endgame. But exactly how powerful was the American war hero? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was he the most powerful of them all? Read ahead to find out the extremity of his ability based on the movies and comics as well.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Captain America Attributes</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complete name: <strong>Steve Rogers</strong>\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aliases: Captain America\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Height: 6’2”\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eye Colour: Blue\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First Appearance in Comics: Captain America Comics #1 (1941)\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First Appearance in Movies: Captain America - The First Avenger (2011)</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">origin</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his</span> Captain America <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">powers?</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve Rogers is the son of a War Veteran, he was, unfortunately, a weak and frail kid. Always inspired to be a part of the Army like his father, he enrolled several times but was unable to get in. His weak physique always the source of his downfall. Professor Abraham Erskine found this weak young man and saw the good heart that resided in him. He enlisted him for Project Rebirth, which was to use the Super Soldier Serum to help fight the war.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1353\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Captain-America-begining.jpg\" alt=\"Captain America begining\" width=\"655\" height=\"426\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good that resided in Steve won him over and was the recipient of the Serum which enhanced him in all possible ways. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weeks of tests that were conducted to check for the good in him had borne fruit. He was now as powerful as they came. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediately being instrumental in the War, helping millions. Which as we realize, is the mere beginning of his adventure.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F020aNi0wS0[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>What are Captain America\'s known powers?</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Captain America isn’t superhuman, he is as strong a human can possibly be and even stronger as well. Ability wise he has agility, strength, speed, and endurance among several others greater than any Olympic athlete that we’ve ever known. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The super soldier enhanced all of his abilities to an extremely great level. Notably, the serum has resulted in him not having as much fatigue. Giving him extraordinary levels of Endurance.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kknc1HFkoZg[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has mastered the American fighting forms of Judo and Boxing along with his own unique fighting style. The combination of all of these skills makes him a worthy adversary indeed. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he is extraordinary as compared to a regular human he has human vulnerabilities as well. Although, his immunity to diseases is extraordinary.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>What is his choice of Weapon?</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We always relate Captain Steve Rogers to the Shield that he carries into every battle. He has had the shield from Day 1 of being Captain America. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shield is made of Vibranium and carries the symbolic star and stripes of Captain America to this day. The design and creation credits have to be given to Howard Stark, the father of our beloved Iron Man, Tony Stark. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vibranium is one of the strongest metals present on Earth makes it a very strong and durable weapon for a man of his calibre to carry.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the comics, the shield is made from a combination of Vibranium and Adamantium (the metal of which Wolverine’s claws are made of). </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the unique nature of its creation, the shield was not ever made again as it was not possible. It was later awarded to Captain America at the start of his career by the government.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1350\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Captain-America-with-thor-hammer-2-min.jpg\" alt=\"Captain with thor hammer 2\" width=\"529\" height=\"529\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then comes Thor’s magic hammer Mjolnir. Odin, Thor’s father curses the hammer that only the worthy may be able to lift it and wield the power of the hammer. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we see in Avengers Endgame and two instances in the comics, Captain America lifts the hammer and is one of the few characters worthy of lifting the magical hammer. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see him pick up the hammer and fight the final battle alongside the other Avengers against Thanos. In a similar instance, he picks up the hammer in the comics in the finale of the fear event and wrecks havoc across the battlefield.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Who are the strongest people he has fought?</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1349\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Captain-America-vs-iron-man-min.jpg\" alt=\"Captain vs iron man\" width=\"695\" height=\"391\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When considering the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America has had some memorable battles. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether the intervention between Iron Man and Thor in the first Avengers movie when the three iconic characters on the screen together for the first-ever time. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or the battle with Iron Man at the end of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America: Civil War</a> when he battles Iron Man alongside Bucky Barnes.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1348\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Captain-America-vs-iron-man-suit-broken-min.jpg\" alt=\" iron man suit broken\" width=\"702\" height=\"395\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZr2AEw3dos[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again in that battle, Captain America comes out on top defeating Iron Man with relative ease. We have to even consider the battle he had with Thanos at the end of Avengers Endgame in which he fought tooth and nail in order to defeat Thanos. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His ability to wield the Mjolnir and use his shield to fight Thanos when all hope was lost was tremendous. His ability to be willing to take on the entire army by himself fighting the battle he had to is an inspiration to all of us.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1351\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Captain-America-with-thor-hammer-min.jpg\" alt=\" thor hammer\" width=\"691\" height=\"389\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3dPoo_Yn8w[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when considering the entire Marvel Universe, the strongest person that Cap would have defeated would have to be Spider-Man.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If there is any marvel hero that has managed to beat almost anyone that has come along it is Spider-Man. He has fought and defeated the X-Men, Dr Doom, The Hulk, and Silver Surfer just to name a few. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for Captain America to have held his own against him would say a lot. But not just hold his own, rather when it has mattered Captain America has managed to get the better of Spidey and won several battles.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, is</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strongest</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marvel</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Character?</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what do we know now? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Captain America has proved himself to be one of the strongest characters in Marvel. And then you add to it the fact that he has defeated the strongest Marvel character there is in Spiderman. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So then it is safe to suggest that Captain America is the strongest character on Marvel’s roster.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you think? Is Captain America the strongest one around? Who is your favourite among Captain America and Iron man? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comment below and let us know your thoughts as well! - <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">The Tv Freak</a></span>\r\n<h2>Read More:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/whats-next-in-marvel-series-movies-and-release-date/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marvel Series: Next 10 Movies</a></li>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/a-top-10-pick-of-hollywood-franchises-you-should-watch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 10 Pick of Hollywood Franchises You Should Watch Before Die</a></li>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-pick-of-hollywood-tv-web-series/\">Top 10 Pick of Hollywood TV/ Web Series</a></li>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/black-widow-2020-film/\">Black Widow (2020 film) | Latest News, Trailer, and Release Date</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>','How Powerful is Captain America | Marvel','','publish','open','open','','how-powerful-is-captain-america-marvel','','https://www.thetvfreak.com/whats-next-in-marvel-series-movies-and-release-date/\nhttps://www.thetvfreak.com/a-top-10-pick-of-hollywood-franchises-you-should-watch/','2021-01-16 11:15:37','2021-01-16 05:45:37','',0,'https://www.thetvfreak.com/?p=1334',0,'post','',0),(1378,5,'2020-07-12 18:01:57','2020-07-12 12:31:57','<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dil Bechara, featuring the late entertainer</span><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/sushant-singh-rajput-facts-journey-to-bollywood/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sushant Singh Rajput</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Sanjana Sanghi; is a revamp of the  Hollywood sentimental movie dependent on a success account \"The Fault In Our Stars\".</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1383 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dil-bechara-min.jpg\" alt=\"dil bechara\" width=\"1024\" height=\"665\" />\r\n<h2><b>Watch Trailer of Dil Bechara</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODAlxW5Pes[/embedyt]</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Dil Bechara StoryLine</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story spins around two young people.

Need to chant this title to myself everyday nowadays! Also a great watch when anxious or stressed. I would like to mention that almost all the award functions demoted me and Farhan from main leads, and nominated us as “supporting actors”. Hrithik and Katrina were nominated as “actors in a leading role”. So by the industry’s own logic, this was a film about a man and a woman falling in love, with the man supported by his friends for whatever decisions he takes. There are many covert and overt ways in which people in the industry lobby against you. In this case it was shamelessly overt. I of course boycotted the awards but Farhan was ok with it. #familyfareawards Very creative artwork @kalakkii</a></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\">A post shared by <a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/abhaydeol/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Abhay Deol</a> (@abhaydeol) on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-19T10:15:24+00:00\">Jun 19, 2020 at 3:15am PDT</time></p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>\r\n<h2><b>SUNNY DEOL</b></h2>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1479 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9.jpg\" alt=\"Sunny Deol\" width=\"1024\" height=\"665\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I don\'t have the foggiest idea whether they are granted night or they are an assortment of on-screen characters around evening time,\" said Sunny Deol in a meeting. </span>The on-screen character will not call them grant night and scrutinized the procedure and its believability.\r\n\r\n\"Here I realize individuals state I will charge this much cash or I will possibly come on the off chance that I get this thing or I won\'t come or give me this unique honour whatnot.\r\n\r\nSo it\'s everything about that.

Although being a nephew of superstar Dharmendra, Abhay Deol never really flaunted his “filmy” background. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, he earned his spot in the acting circuit on his own. Though he has “Deol” as a surname, he didn’t take any help from his uncle Dharmendra to pursue an acting career. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would come as a shocker to everyone as it was usually thought that he is another product of nepotism.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Abhay School Days &amp; Debut</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1992 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-min.jpg\" alt=\"abhay Deol young\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since his school days, Abhay was fascinated by the world of characters and acting. He took up acting classes and soon joined theatre. He did many plays from his school and later college. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, he was a theatre artist first, before becoming a Bollywood star. He often stated in many interviews that he chose the acting career himself. He wasn’t pushed into it by his father or uncle.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abhay Deol genuinely liked acting on stage in theatres and wanted to follow his passion and make a career out of it. In his school days, he learned dancing as well as karate to keep himself fit. He also refused to eat junk food as he knew it would de-shape his body and it would affect him later to land leading roles in movies.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1993 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-min.jpg\" alt=\"Abhay deol Socha na tha\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon his talent was spotted by<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imtiaz_Ali_(director)\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Imtiaz Ali</a> in theatre workshops. After a long casting process, Abhay Deol was finalized as a lead in ‘Socha Na Tha’. Abhay Deol starred against Ayesha Takiya. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His performance was appreciated in the film. The movie was average in terms of box office collections. It was directed by then lesser-known director Imtiaz Ali, who later produced gems like Jab We Met and Rockstar. Both the actor and director received praise for their noteworthy performances. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1994 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-min.jpg\" alt=\"Abhay deol honnymoon\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abhay tasted his first success in ‘Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd (IMDb: 6.1) released in 2007. This gave a huge boost to Abhay’s career and he also gained a lot of confidence in himself after this film. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film showcased the story of six couples who traveled to Goa to celebrate their honeymoon. The film was produced by Farhaan Akhtar, who later collaborated with Abhay Deol in one of his career-best movies ‘Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara’.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Abhay Rise to Prominence</b></h2>\r\n<h3>Beginning in the Industry:</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year 2007 saw Abhay in prime light. After tasting commercial and raw success in ‘Honeymoon Travels’, he went on to do two of <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-movies-of-abhay-deol/\">Abhay Deol\'s best movies</a>. ‘Ek Chalis Ki Last Local’ was a crime film set in the fast-paced city of Mumbai. It showcased the struggles of a common man and his journey on the path of crime and destruction.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1995 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-min.jpg\" alt=\"‘Ek Chalis Ki Last Local’\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was followed by a thriller ‘Manorama Six Feet Under’. The later, ‘Manorama Six Feet Under’ is considered one of his best works of all time. Also, the movie is one of the best-underrated Bollywood movies of all time. ‘Manorama’, if you haven’t seen it, is a must-watch and we highly recommend you to watch it. basically, the plot is in Rajasthan and has some shocking twists which makings it an engaging <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/best-crime-movies-based-on-true-life-stories/\">crime-thriller</a>. </span>\r\n<h3>Now Time for the best contribution:</h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1989 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-min.jpg\" alt=\"Oye Lucky Lucky Oye\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abhay went on to do many prominent roles later on. His film, Oye Lucky Lucky Oye in 2008 was a black comedy. Usually black-comedies bomb at the box and get negative responses. But surprisingly, this film received high critical acclaim and even today is a delight to watch. But it was a disaster at the box office because it released a day after the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai. Not one person dared to step out and go in public places as the terrorist attacks shook the whole country. Hence the makers of this brilliant film lost their money, alas, to terrorism. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1990 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-min.jpg\" alt=\"Dev D\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His first major stardom moment came in 2009 when he accepted the movie ‘DevD’ directed by Anurag Kashyap. Devdas had been already made into a movie two times earlier. But DevD brought in a whole new angle to the classic and discussed modern-day problems of youth.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATZB8mwU3M0[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also took a stand on drugs, alcohol, and abusive problems of the youth nowadays. The film was highly praised for its experimental and noteworthy soundtrack and exceptional narrative. Abhay Deol’s performance as modern-day Dev struck a chord with the masses and was gladly remarkable in that role. It felt as if the actor was at ease in his character and only he was to play it.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1784 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/14-min.jpg\" alt=\"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara(2011) Abhay Deol\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-15-movies-on-friendship-that-you-must-watch/\">best movies on friendship</a> you should watch of all time. The year 2011 brought Abhay his first nomination in the Filmfare Awards as Best Supporting Actor. His decision to take on the role of Kabir in ‘Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara’ was spot on and changed his life. The movie is considered a modern classic and <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">best Bollywood movies</a> ever made. Abhay Deol was in a lead role alongside Farhaan Akhtar and Hritik Roshan. The film also had Kalki Koechlin, Katrina Kaif, and Naseeruddin Shah in supporting roles.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch the trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrpcDgC3zU[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ZNMD earned more than 1.53 Billion rupees worldwide and went on to break the record of Dhoom 2 at the box-office. The location of this film was primarily in Spain. Abhay Deol gave him 100% for the film. He took training from professionals to be a deep-sea diver, just to be comfortable while filming it for the diving sequence in the film. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Abhay Deol Controversies</b></h2>\r\n<h3><b>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara awards nominations</b>:</h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1991 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-min.jpg\" alt=\"Abhay Deol \" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\nAfter the suicide of <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/sushant-singh-rajput-facts-journey-to-bollywood/\">Shushant Singh Rajput</a>, he said something big.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abhay sparked a controversy regarding Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara when he slammed B-town for considering him as a supporting actor in the movie. The film has 3 main leads, played by Abhay, Hritik, and Farhaan. But the nomination was only for Hritik Roshan in Best Actor category in various award functions including the Filmfare.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abhay Deol and Farhaan Akhtar were in the Best Supporting Actor nomination category. And this clearly showed that the industry award functions were ignoring them as potential leads for the film. This made Abhay furious and criticized the functions. Later Farhaan clarified that he didn’t feel bad about it and gladly accepted being in that category.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmUI0esRvWA[/embedyt]\r\n<h3>Abhay Deol A<strong>t MAMI festival:</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People were also trolling him when he spoke openly at the MAMI festival in Mumbai about banning the Pakistani actors and filmmakers. He said that if we are banning Pakistanis, then the import-export trade, goods, and other things also should be banned, and not just artists. Though many thought he was fearless in his opinions, some trolled him for raising voice in support of Paki actors and also called him anti-national. </span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP5dIHo9NTA[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you think about Abhay’s personality and his ability as an actor?

Or as they say in Maharashtra, your local? What difficulties can one go through if he/she misses out on the last train of the day? The plot of this film is the same. Two individuals miss the last local-train at 1:40 am at night. What follows is a fast-paced crime-thriller that will keep you engaged through-out the movie’s running minutes. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abhay Deol and Neha Dhupia do a commendable job in taking the movie forward and keep you guessing what’s going to happen next.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKVxfUjjT_A[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>8) Socha Na Tha (2005)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.4</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Imtiaz Ali</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Abhay Deol, Ayesha Takia, Ayesha Jhulka</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2008 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-min-min.jpg\" alt=\"Abhay Deol \" width=\"600\" height=\"384\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Written and directed by Imtiaz Ali, this movie is typical of the director’s genre. A light-hearted <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-romantic-comedies-that-are-forever-in-our-hearts/\">romantic comedy</a>. Socha Na Tha was the debut film of Abhay Deol. Imtiaz Ali had spotted his acting talents after watching him act in theatre plays and undoubtedly thought of offering him the lead role in his film. The plot is pretty straight-forward.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abhay meets Ayesha Takia for an arranged marriage. But they reject each other and opt to be friends. Later when they get engaged to different partners, they realize the love for each other. The movie did average business at the box office, but enough for Abhay to kickstart his career.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k0CDfpTb30[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>7) Raanjhanaa (2013)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.6</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Aanand L.

Rai directed this superb romantic drama. It follows the story of a young couple who fight against society for their love to be accepted. This movie was the debut of south superstar Dhanush in the Bollywood industry. Surprisingly, the performance of Sonam Kapoor was also appreciated in the film. Abhay Deol plays the role of a young politician who aims to lead the rally against the ruling party. His short role in the film is the film’s highlight.</span>\r\n\r\nSo this is one of Abhay Deol Movies in which he has shown to the audience the best action in very little time and dialogues.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER9vmhxFucg[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>6) Chakravyuh (2012)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 6.9</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Prakash Jha</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arjun Rampal, Abhay Deol, Manoj Bajpayee</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2007 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-min-1.jpg\" alt=\"Abhay Deol \" width=\"600\" height=\"384\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another brilliant crime drama by Prakash Jha. Chakravyuh follows the story of two IPS officers, who take on the task of fighting the Naxal community in Jharkhand. The story of this film is somewhat similar to the Hollywood classic ‘The Departed’ where a police undercover joins the mafia to help the police catch them. Abhay Deol plays the rat who joins the Naxals and informs the police about their whereabouts. The film is shot in a very realistic way, as all Prakash Jha films are. That makes it an authentic viewing experience.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnamEA8iLGY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>5) Shanghai (2012)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.2</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Dibakar Banerjee</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Emraan Hashmi, Abhay Deol, Prasenjit Chatterjee</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2009 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-min-1.jpg\" alt=\"Shanghai (2012)\" width=\"600\" height=\"384\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Directed by Dibakar Banerjee, this political crime drama will leave you in awe. The performances in the film are exceptionally great. The on-screen chemistry between Emraan and Abhay as friends will leave you wanting for more. Both are showing their extreme acting talents in this one. Especially Emraan. He nailed his role to perfection.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNbGmjD2_qQ[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4) Oye Lucky Lucky Oye (2008)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.7</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Dibakar Banerjee</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Abhay Deol, Paresh Rawal, Neetu Chandra </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2013 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-min-min.jpg\" alt=\"Oye Lucky Lucky Oye (2008)\" width=\"600\" height=\"384\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dibakar Banerjee is known to make underrated gems. Oye Lucky Lucky Oye is a black comedy crime movie that has an interesting plot. The story revolves around Lucky who is a thief. The media goes on to make him a star as they debug his burglaries trying to figure out how he carried out the crimes. This one will make you roll with laughter. Although a disaster at the box office, this film is highly rated by the critics.</span>\r\n\r\nSo if you want to watch a strange comedy than this is one of the best Abhay Deol Movies.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3paPF30NJhg[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3) DevD (2009)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 8.0</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Anurag Kashyap</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Abhay Deol, Mahie Gill, Kalki Koechlin</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2014 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-min-min.jpg\" alt=\"DevD (2009)\" width=\"600\" height=\"384\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the news broke out in 2009 that Anurag Kashyap was making the remake of Devdas, everyone was sceptical about it. Especially after Sanjay Leela Bhansali nailed it in his version of the classic, with the <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/successful-self-made-bollywood-stars-who-had-no-root-in-industry/\">star cast of Shah Rukh, Aishwarya and Madhuri</a>. But little did people expect DevD to turn out so well. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, people were negative about Abhay Deol playing the title role of Dev, which was previously played by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan. But when the movie came out, everyone only had praises for the actor and director Anurag Kashyap. The film talks about modern-day youth problems and their take on drugs and prostitution. Career-best performance of Abhay Deol in a lead role.

Had it been a commercial success back then, it could have easily made it into a detective franchise. </span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjzr3bBHuho[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>1) Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 8.1</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Zoya Akhtar</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Hrithik Roshan, Farhan Akhtar, Abhay Deol</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2015 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-min-min.jpg\" alt=\"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011) Abhay Deol\" width=\"600\" height=\"384\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who can say that this modern-day classic is the directorial debut of Zoya Akhtar?

It remained just as loveable and enjoyable as the first one.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cv2ueYnKjg[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13.

This second installment of the Avengers brought out the fears of so many of the members and Tony Starks in particular. With Ultron being a manifestation of the fear that lived within Tony to become a threat to all of mankind. With the introduction of new characters, the Avengers must now rise.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1OKBqHICMQ[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14.

The name as literal as the superhero, it would not be smart to underestimate his ability to resize himself as the Ant-Man along with his allies who are, yes you guessed it, Ants.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfOZWGLT1JM[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15.

Although a Captain America movie, it is safe to say it was as good as another Avengers movie, with the main Avengers all returning for this one. With the conflicts between the members as high as ever, they now fight one other for their ideals. And oh, Spiderman is finally here in the MCU.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKrVegVI0Us[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">16.

A sceptical man about the world of magic goes on to be the greatest sorcerer around. Played by the wonderful Benedict Cumberbatch (Yes, we’ve spelt it right) the charisma and practicality along with the wonderful storytelling make it a very important movie in the universe. When watching the movies in chronological order in 2020 it is very important to watch this movie for story purposes.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7gvFravm4A[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">18.

Black Panther was absolutely loved by audiences and critics, with the movie reaching the Oscars as well and being the only Marvel movie to reach those heights. About a seemingly third-world country Wakanda which has hidden its advancement from the world, Black Panther was a complete game-changer in the Marvel Universe.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">19.

And along with it, we have Tom Hiddleston playing Loki which is another heartbreak on its own. Arguably the best Thor movie made out of the trilogy, the humour and storytelling are wonderful and the music is absolutely magnificent. The God of Thunder has to fight the battle that has come to haunt him from his father\'s past.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBxQ_XYQJhc[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20.

And the fans of Captain America has seen a lot in it. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Captain America uses Thor Hammer in this movie and that scene was awesome. It creates a big question, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/how-powerful-is-captain-america-marvel/\">is Captain America is the strongest superhero</a>. With the excitement levels on record highs and constant screaming in the theatres, all we can say is “Avengers Assemble”.

It is not that he didn’t want his daughter Amrita to be Successful but yes he had fear because of all sorts of news he heard about the Bollywood Industry. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But believe it or not Today he is proud of his Daughter.</span>\r\n<h2>What does she think when signing a movie?</h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crpVluja2C0[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>Struggle for a Big Role</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, Amrita used to work for an advertising agency as a copywriter and later as a freelancer for a lifestyle magazine. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She sometimes said that if my father would have supported me in my initial days then I would have done graduation in acting rather than doing my honors in English.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNekk07Qt2g[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because doing an acting course gives the foundation and also takes you a step ahead from the other contenders who are in the race to become an actor.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now as soon as her graduation and post-graduation completed she jumped on to auditions.

Although a fairly successful career with a few significant movies, he isn’t a household name yet. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His talent is very obvious and has been wonderful in everything he has acted in.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Highway to Extraction, the quality he has shown has not found the recognition that he deserves. So what has been the story of the star that is <strong>Randeep Hooda</strong>? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read on ahead to find out what has been the story of his rise from the bottom to the top.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young Days</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jat_people\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hindu Jat family</a>, he had an orthodox family with his father a doctor along with his sister as well. A middle-class family with his mother a social worker and his younger brother is a software engineer. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He lived many of his young years with his grandmother with his parents traveling very often having several years in the Middle East living there as well.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2329 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-min-13.jpg\" alt=\"randeep hooda happy birthday\" width=\"840\" height=\"520\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While his family wanted him to become a doctor, his ambitions were very different. Doing well in sports while in his boarding school at a young age. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When moved to Delhi Public School he admitted that the transition was difficult for him. Considering that his interests were elsewhere and his sports so good that he had reached a National Level it was quickly realized that he would not be becoming a Doctor as his family wanted him to be. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving to Australia in the 90s, he studied for his master’s degree in marketing while working several jobs such as a waiter and taxi driver as well. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His interests found their way to theatre acting as well as he took on roles and excelled at them.

Well, he was the painter who first gave us the painting of Mother India. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">Bollywood movie</a> is exceptionally great in handling topics such as nudism, sexism, and nationalism.

Although the film bombed at the box-office, the reason we included the Hindi film in the top 10 movies of Randeep Hooda is purely based on his acting skills.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2325 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/earn-more.-20-min-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"randeep hooda movies\" width=\"840\" height=\"440\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way he has portrayed the romantic lead is truly exceptional and believable. Very rarely you can feel the strong bond between the leads, and this film can make you strongly believe that the two actors are in love. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Randeep Hooda, who previously had not done the role of such kind, gave one of his best performances. Surely if you haven’t watched the film, we recommend you to give it a go!</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZuGVyVNVAY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3) Sarbjit (2016)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.3</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Omung Kumar</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Randeep Hooda, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Richa Chadha </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year 2016 saw Randeep Hooda deliver gems like Laal Rang, Sultan, Do Lafzon Ki Kahani, and finally Sarbjit.

In 1991, Sarbjit was being declared a terrorist and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film became one of Randeep Hooda hit movies after earning more than 50 crores at the box-office. The production cost was a mere 15 crores for the movie and hence it turned out to be a profitable venture for the producers. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Randeep Hooda as Sarbjit leaves a lasting impression and makes us root for the man who faced so much injustice in his life.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aishwarya Rai Bachchan graced the role of Sarbjit’s sister and was effective as always on the silver screen. At first, nobody knows about Aishwarya that she will play the lead’s sister. But after the screening of the movie, everyone was happy with the performance that the actress did a commendable job in playing a 22-year-old, as well as a 60-year-old in the same movie. Critics loved this movie and the performance of the characters. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These kinds of Randeep Hooda films again proves that Randeep is a bankable actor to carry the movie on his own shoulders.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1kYpWU7apI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>2) Highway (2014)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.6</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Imtiaz Ali</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alia Bhatt, Randeep Hooda, Durgesh Kumar</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A total masterpiece by Imtiaz Ali, Highway is a grand package. The film has outstanding music, great direction, mindblowing performances, and a twist, no one sees coming. This Bollywood movie became the highlight of 2014 and both Randeep as well as Alia’s career. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A very lesser known fact of the movie is that it is based on an episode from Zee TV series called Rishtey. The episode was with the same name as the movie. Imtiaz Ali himself wrote and directed it.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2323 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-min-min-min.jpg\" alt=\"randeep films\" width=\"672\" height=\"416\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film showcases the story of a girl, who discovers freedom after she has been kidnapped. Also, most of the movie is a travel journey. You will this movie more interesting than the details are in the trailer.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence we can see lots of beautiful sceneries, and soulful places in India we didn’t know existed. Also, we see the country so superbly in the film. And Imtiaz did his career-best work while directing the film. Another highlight of this movie is the brilliant music, none other than the legend himself, A R Rehman. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Randeep Hooda bagged his first Stardust Award in the category of Best Actor. On the same night, Imtiaz Ali also received an award for the Best Director. Randeep Hooda also received nominations for Most Entertaining Actor in a Social - Drama Film - Male category in the BIG Star Entertainment Awards and Best Actor in a leading role at the Star Guild Awards.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t be misguided by the IMDB rating for this one! The film is one of the modern gems of Indian Cinema!</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSrDD52bx4A[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>1) Extraction (2020)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 6.7</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Sam Hargrave</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Chris Hemsworth, Bryon Lerum, Ryder Lerum, Randeep Hooda</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Netflix special Extraction marked the Hollywood debut of Randeep Hooda.

This is the only movie in Randeep Hooda <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/a-top-10-pick-of-hollywood-franchises-you-should-watch/\">Hollywood movies list</a> but in the future, we will surely get more.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The action in the film will make you stir in your seats. From the opening scene to the climax of the film, each and every frame is just awesome. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film features chase sequences,<a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-13-war-movies-based-on-real-stories/\"> fist-fights, gunfights</a>, and even a few of the bazookas flying around. All the efforts, just to save a little kid.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6P3nI6VnlY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Bonus Movie:</b></h2>\r\n<h2><b>Laal Rang (2016)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 8.0</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Syed Ahmad Afzal</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Randeep Hooda, Akshay Oberoi, Rajniesh Duggall  </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/best-crime-movies-based-on-true-life-stories/\">Crime and action</a> suites Randeep Hooda. The reason why the movie gained a high rating is because of the direction and performances.

The film does have a shade of grey, which is why it is a bit darker than the usual crime thrillers.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzWsMbLwZ1M[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hope you liked our list of top 10 best movies of Randeep Hooda.

Tired of the 9 to 5 like so many of us, he decided to pursue his true love, acting.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of making his debut on relatively unknown platforms and shows without a huge audience. He has developed into a wonderful actor. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">H</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e has shown the country why he should be taken more seriously as an actor. So, if you are not familiar with him or do and want to know more about him, read on ahead to find out how he developed from being irrelevant to being the underrated start that he is today.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2359 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-min-15.jpg\" alt=\"Jitendra Kumar\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Similar but Different Beginning</span></h2>\r\n<h3>The Beginning:</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jitendra Kumar like so many others was a young smart kid who was pursuing Engineering. As we know being an Engineer in India is the equivalent of being a drop in the ocean. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He went to IIT Kharagpur which is as prestigious as it sounds but at the same time not as much as well. As so many do, he decided to be a part of the stage acting. That would happen there in which he did quite well earning a name for himself within his campus. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2360 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-min-15.jpg\" alt=\"Jitendra Kumar kota\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He kept acting within the college and outside of it. Travelling with other artists and winning awards everywhere he acted outside as well. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He admitted that the recognition outside of the college, which came from veteran theatre actors meant a lot and gave him reassurances. Not many know this but he even had the small role of a Taxi Driver in the <strong>Naseeruddin Shah</strong> movie <strong>‘A Wednesday’</strong>.</span>\r\n<h3>The Big Decision:</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like so many others, after Engineering he found himself in a remote town in Karnataka, working hours that did not let him breathe. No friends, no family, and a social life that did not exist. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The days were very hard on Jitendra. One day, he snapped and screamed at his superiors. The Japanese MNC he worked at gave him no peace, long hours, and humiliation at every turn. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His snap came as a shock throughout the company and he left his job tired of it. He mentions how it was quite a low point in his life, living there gave him his worst birthday ever with no calls from friends and a few from family.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2363 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-min-10.jpg\" alt=\"Jitendra Kumar tvf\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His snap and throwing away of a job did not go down in his family well. He tried to reassure his parents but they refused to listen with his father not speaking to him for a while. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a heavy heart, he moved to Mumbai. Where he was invited by his old Senior living there pursuing a writing career. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He mentions how he asked if he will be paid, his friend tells him that he won’t be paid but he will get to act. And that has Jitendra sold and he moves to Mumbai to help his friend with a start-up which we all now know as ‘The Viral Fever Videos’ or ‘TVF’.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acting Freedom</span></h2>\r\n<h3>TVF, The Famous Youtube Channel:</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJcSUSzUeFm8W9P7UUlSeQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">TVF</a> took off soon after with Jitendra Kumar having an important role in the acting part. The Youtube channel found attention all over the country. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Jitendra being the heart of so many roles that he took on, it grew exponentially. The struggle was immense early in his days, with Jitendra admitting that he would live with money worries.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2362 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-min-14.jpg\" alt=\"Jitendra Kumar\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching the rickshaw meter hoping he had enough money as he went to auditions were a part of his everyday life. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon enough the auditions did not work out. But his natural acting skills were on display on their up and rising Youtube channel. The small work continued with him doing IIT coaching up to three times a week hoping for some financial stability. </span>\r\n<h3><strong>PITCHERS</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then came Pitchers. Eventually, they made something that took everyone by storm. A show about a group of people who have their own startup. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand better, you must understand that this show was before the days of Netflix, Amazon prime shows. This show was something that Indians had not seen before and loved the fact that there was so much quality from something so low budget. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2365 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-min-10.jpg\" alt=\"Jitendra Kumar tvf pitchers\" width=\"750\" height=\"421\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pitchers was a huge hit, with crowds gathering every time they visited colleges and the people shouting dialogues. Huge cheers and internet popularity was what they now had achieved. They continued to make more shows and Jitendra who was now known as ‘Jeetu’ gathered more fame. His name with his roles ahead including a show called ‘Kota Factory’, in which he went from ‘Jeetu’ to ‘Jeetu Bhaiya’.</span>\r\n<h3>The Big Hit<strong> \"Panchayat\":</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His rise continued and he eventually got an Amazon Prime show called ‘Panchayat’ in which he was the lead. The show was an immense hit and had a parallel to the life he lived so many years ago when he got a job after IIT Kharagpur. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The remote location, the lack of social life, and the difficulties he faced allowed him to understand the role he took on so much better. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2366 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-min-8.jpg\" alt=\"Jitendra Kumar panchayat\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was not the first time, he had showcased something from his life onto the screen. When in a show he re-enacted the scene that took place when he confronted his father about his resigning from the job. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The frustration and ranting that he expressed with the emotion of the kid finding his way in life and the strict father looking to make sure his son would not be struggling for such a long time in life was something loved by everyone.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2370 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/39cbe2a3-a69b-43ba-9ddb-58e62179a9d0-1.jpg\" alt=\"jitendra kumar ayushman\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" />\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final Thoughts? </span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He is a wonderful actor and he has shown that he is very good with so many examples. Jitendra keeps adding to his resume and acting profile with wonderful work. He keeps doing and we hope he keeps doing such work ahead as well.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What has been your favourite Jeetu Bhaiya work?

But after five years his career started to climb up the graph with his movie <strong>Hum Saath Saath Hain</strong> in the year 1999.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2379 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-min-16.jpg\" alt=\"Dil chata hai Saif Ali Khan\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thereafter he was sort of qualified to play comedy lead roles in the Bollywood movies <strong>Dil Chahta hai</strong> and Kal Ho Na Ho.

Saif played a single male lead in this Hindi movie, and you would be surprised to know that he was awarded the <strong>National Film Award</strong> for the same movie. Then After a few years of in and out in the Bollywood movie Industry. And his comeback in the year 2012 with the movie <strong>Cocktail</strong>.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is debatable that his golden period was from 2006 to 2012 where he appeared in numerous Hindi movies such as <strong>Kurbann(2009)</strong>, the blockbuster<strong> Race </strong>(2008 and it’s a sequel in 2013).

And it was on Bekhudi’s sets where he met Amrita Singh and fell in love with her.</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After his Divorce, Saif dated a Swiss Actress but after three years they broke up. Saif is a very introverted person and his hobbies are playing the guitar and traveling around the world.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you know that Nawab’s real name is Sajid Ali Khan but after entering into the Bollywood Industry he changed it to Saif Ali Khan?</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saif’s grandfather and his father were cricketers and both represented India and her mother hails from a Bollywood background, she also tells that Saif was very spontaneous at his young age. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>What we Can Expect from his Autobiography?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone is very curious about the upcoming Autobiography on Saif Ali Khan. As soon as he shares this news in social media everyone started to predict that what are the things which might be included in Nawab’s Autobiography. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us discuss and predict some of the incidents which might be included in Saif’s Autobiography.</span>\r\n<h3>Marriage at Young Age:</h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2381 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-min-15.jpg\" alt=\"Saif Ali Khan Amrita marriage\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can expect a short clip of Khan’s education especially abroad and then his return to Indian and working for an <strong>advertising firm</strong>. Nawab’s personal life is also too interesting to show it on the screen like getting married at a very young age and them becoming the father of his two children <strong>Sara Ali Khan</strong> and <strong>Ibrahim</strong>. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then after a healthy relationship of about 13 years getting separated from Amrita Singh. And after a couple of years marrying the famous Actress Kareena Kapoor and again becoming the father of Taimur (who already is a social media sensation).</span>\r\n<h3>Struggle Time:</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His struggling days can also be portrayed in his autobiography. His struggle started after his father Shri Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi‘s demise, where he and his family lost the ownership of their iconic Pataudi Residence, they had to pay rent to some Hotel Owners for that House. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later after a lot of hustle Saif regained ownership of the house with his hard-earned money from the Hindi Film Industry.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once he also stated in an interview that after his education was over abroad and when he returned to India, his father had sent him to his ad agency to get a job because he was partying a lot. And the ad truly happened in Gwalior. So this incident might also be shown in his movie. Also, the roller coaster ride of his filmy career might also be shown.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2377 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-min-11.jpg\" alt=\"Saif Ali Khan \" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s talk about criticization.

An actor whom we have seen in several movies but at times forget to remember his name. We often never realize that this actor is even a part of the movie until we see his face come up in between of a movie. Prateik Babbar may be an exceptional actor. But the fame he has found has been unfortunately very limited.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actor who has been on the screen since 2008, has made strides in the industry but at the end of it all has not made a name for himself as big as he would have liked to make. Yet he is an actor whom we do know about. While he may not be the biggest name in Bollywood, it is a name with a story behind it. So read on ahead to find out about the name and story that is Prateik Babbar.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prateik Babbar Early Days</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prateik has a story to be told, nobody can argue against that and after reading ahead you will find out exactly what we mean by that. He started low by being an assistant to <strong>Prahlad Kakkar</strong> who is an advertisement filmmaker. Babbar worked with him as a <strong>Production Assistant</strong> and gained some valuable experience. But with his goal being acting, he kept trying to step into the limelight.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since he was working in the advertisement sector, eventually he did receive some advertisement roles including an ad for KitKat which is a product all of us know quite well. His work with Kakkar allowed him to step into the advertising sector easier and gave him opportunities to start applying for acting roles. The son of a popular industry couple, he is a question of whether a part of nepotism or not which is a topic we will get into later. The actor kept auditioning for roles and eventually his big break came in 2008 in a movie all us know all too well.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Debut Success</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2008, Prateik was cast in an<strong> Aamir Khan Production</strong> that also starred <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan_(Bollywood_actor)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Imran Khan</strong></a> and <strong>Genelia Dsouza</strong>. That cast would remind us all of just one movie <strong>Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na</strong>. This movie did so well and made a space in the audience\'s heart. This is also one of <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-15-movies-on-friendship-that-you-must-watch/\">the best Movies on friendship in Bollywood</a>. Cast in a supporting role of the movie as the young annoying brother of Genelia, Babbar found the success that he craved. He won the critical acclamation for his acting and won awards as well.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2441 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-min-13.jpg\" alt=\"Prateik Babbar debut\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prateik received nominations such as Best Supporting Role and Best Debut as well for his role in Jaane Tu ya Jaane Na at the 54th Filmfare awards. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He went on to do several more movies over the next few years. Including having as many as 4 films in 2011. Those four movies included ‘<strong>Dum Maaro Dum</strong>’ with Abhishek Bachchan which was an Action-Thriller. He also acted with the Senior Bachchan in the Social-Drama <strong>‘Aarakshan’</strong> directed by Prakash Jha which had an immense cast with Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan, and Saif Ali Khan. The film was a commercial success and Prateik kept earning a name for himself. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2446 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-min-14.jpg\" alt=\"Ekk Deewana Tha \" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\nHe also did a famous romantic movie in which he played a mechanical engineer who is love action and wanted to follow his passion. He falls in love with a girl and now the story starts. It is one of <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-romantic-comedies-that-are-forever-in-our-hearts/\">the must-watch romantic movies.</a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His profile includes several more movies in the time such as <strong>‘My Friend Pinto</strong>’ and ‘<strong>Dhobi Ghaat’</strong>. After being in a string of movies, Babbar then fell off the radar for a while in 2013. He stopped making movies and had issues in his personal life that he had to take care of. Find out ahead what had him fall off the radar in such a manner. </span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addiction and Recovery</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2013, Prateik realized about his level of substance abuse. He realized that he was an addict and went into rehab. He joined a rehabilitation program in Mumbai in 2013 and decided to fight against his addiction. Once he recovered and came out of sobriety he decided to further improve his acting skills and join an acting school while being the best version of himself.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2443 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-min-19.jpg\" alt=\"Prateik Babbar life\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He decided to take up a course in method acting at the Jeff Goldberg Studio in 2016. It is a welcome change to see an already established actor doing well and trying to improve himself by joining an acting school. Especially with method acting being such a difficult art to master. His big return after a phase of recovery was in 2018 when he returned with success as well. But more on that later.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nepotism or not?</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An important question that comes to the mind of many when reading or talking about Prateik Babbar is whether he is a product of <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/nepotism-and-favouritism-in-bollywood-star-kids-vs-outsiders/\">Nepotism</a> or not. Prateik is the son of actress <strong>Smita Patil</strong> and <strong>Raj Babbar</strong>. While he is the son of such a huge name, it is not that he approached YRF or Karan Johar and walked into the next movie that they were making. It was a different story as we discussed.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2442 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-min-19.jpg\" alt=\"Prateik Babbar family\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prateik found his footing as an assistant and worked and found the work that he wanted. It is difficult to know how much of an influence having famous and rich parents made on his career. It is obvious that the famous parents’ background gives him an added advantage in terms of knowing people etc. But it is not that he did not find his own way in the industry. So, whether he is a product of nepotism or not is a topic that is up for discussion and debate. But for now, he is a part of the industry and even is now. How? Read our next section to find that out.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prateik Babbar </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Return and Resumption of Success?</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever since his return to the industry in 2018, Babbar has been in around 6 movies and has found success in several. His big return was in Baaghi 2 which had Tiger Shroff in the cast with Prateik as the main villain of the story. With this new beginning for him, it was a huge commercial success and gave him the platform he needed. He then went on to make several great movies such as Chicchore, Mulk, Darbar, etc. There is no denying that he is a wonderful actor and we’re sure we will see much more success for him!</span>\r\n<h2>Prateik Babbar A Fitness Freak:</h2>\r\nYou can check his Instagram is full of related to the gym, art, boxing.

The 2007 release has been ignored by many, but RDJ fans can never stop adoring his performance as the cocky principle in Charlie Barlett. This coming to age story is filled with emotions, funny scenes, and the ever good-looking Robert Downey Jr!</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_DVwLq0wn0[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>9) </b><b>Bowfinger </b><b>(1999)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 6.4</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Frank Oz</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Robert Downey Jr</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2568 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-min.jpg\" alt=\"rdj Bowfinger (1999)\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally gifted with comic timing, Robert Downey Jr gives a memorable performance in Bowfinger. His funny approach to the role of a film producer will keep you wanting for more. Although the screen presence is very less, RDJ makes the most out of each and every frame. The film is never talked about and is usually overshadowed by his other works. But during his early days as an actor, delivering such class performance is something which only Robert Downey Jr can do!</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkbHfeWfxHw[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>8) The Soloist (2009)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 6.7</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Joe Wright</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Foxx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jamie Foxx</a>, Robert Downey Jr., Catherine Keener</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2569 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-min.jpg\" alt=\"robert downey jr The Soloist (2009)\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happens when you cast two great actors in a film?

One look at the cast and any idiot can say for sure that this is a Marvel film. Only to contradict the fact that it is not a Marvel film! This is one of <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/best-crime-movies-based-on-true-life-stories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the best Crime Movies Based on True Life Stories</a>.

A fellow cartoonist is determined to play detective in order to catch hold of the criminal. This is considered to be a modern classic in the genre of suspense thrillers. No list can ever be made of the best movies by Robert Downey Jr without mentioning Zodiac at least once!</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNncHPl1UXg[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>6) The Judge (2014)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.4</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: David Dobkin</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Robert Downey Jr., Robert Duvall, Vera Farmiga</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2571 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7-min.jpg\" alt=\"The Judge (2014)\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are very few movies of Robert Downey Jr where his role has been totally serious. This is one of those movies. This movie is also one of <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/courtroom-movies-based-on-real-life-stories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the best courtroom movies based on true stories</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fantastic performance by the cast, RDJ as usual blows away your mind. Each and every single frame in which RDJ is seen; is just brilliant. He plays a father and a son. The film explores the relationship of a father with his son, at the same time handling the bitter relationship with his own father.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep all the drama aside, the crime angle in the movie is just icing on the cake! On the top, the accused is the Judge himself, played by Robert Duvall who is Robert Donwey Jr’s father in the film. Robert is the big hot-shot lawyer who takes up the case to save his father’s reputation in the small town.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of twists and turns in this one, which you surely don’t wanna miss.

Robert Downey Jr is certainly one of them. On the bitter side of his 50s, Robert nailed the role of Dr. Dolittle. Although the film met with harsh reviews, it was refreshing to see RDJ pleasing the kids by making a kid-centric film. It was a no brainer.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The adventures of Dr. Dolittle are captured beautifully on the screen and it met with an excellent CGI from Disney. If you are looking for a fun entertaining movie to watch for the weekend, Dolittle is what we recommend!</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEf412bSPLs[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4) Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.5</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Shane Black</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2573 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9-min.jpg\" alt=\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguably one of the best movies of Robert Downey Jr. In a comic role. In a crime thriller comedy. This movie was the career-changing decision for RDJ as it turned out to be a huge success and also got him into the eyes of the studio, of whom Robert became the major selling face! Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ironically has nothing to do with its title.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s an out to out black comedy set in the backdrop of Hollywood itself. With RDJ at his performing best, a sheer brilliant story and an out of the box screenplay are some factors that make this movie stand out from the rest.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__PnD1HWXSo[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3) Tropic Thunder (2008)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.0</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Ben Stiller</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2574 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/10-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tropic Thunder (2008)\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only thing which could come in between Robert Downey Jr and an Oscar was Heath Ledger’s performance in The Dark Knight. RDJ shows his masterclass in this junkie movie. This comedy will in a literal sense blow your mind away. The plot of this movie is simple.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A film crew trying to shoot some war events. But the simpler it seems, the more complex it gets! Robert Downey Jr plays an Australian actor, who plays an African-American in the film they are trying to shoot. What follows is we get to witness a mixture of Nick Fury and Tony Stark, long before they even became famous!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is totally hilarious and can cause severe stomach aches while watching (due to laughter of course)!

Fans all over the world rejoiced after this news broke out. And as always, RDJ delivered his top-notch acting performance.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been always the debate going on; who is the better Sherlock, Robert Downey Jr, or Benedict Cumberbatch?

Chris Evans stars as Jake Wyler showing a typical ‘jock’ in a high school. Showing a bunch of giggling high school girls and the typical story that all the teen movies have. It was an attempt to mock all of them. It had jock “Jake Wyler” making a bet that he would turn a shy artist in the school into the Prom Queen that year. A movie that can be found on Netflix, Chris Evans number 10 movie on our list is one that is up for debate.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGxy6q5NiOI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>9) </b><b>Fantastic Four (2005)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 5.7</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Drew Goddard</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, Chris Hemsworth</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2584 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/8-min-1.jpg\" alt=\"Fantastic Four (2005)\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chris has already shown his charisma and the fact that he is a bankable star when it comes to ensemble casts. He usually outshines other cast members in ensemble cast movies such as The Avengers. In another movie that is made based on Comic Movies and is well technically Marvel. But this movie is definitely not a part of the MCU. Chris Evans stars as Johnny Storm in The Fantastic Four. Long before he was Captain America, he was the young, proud, and brash Human Torch which everyone enjoyed watching.

This movie shows a team of Elite Special forces unit who is out for revenge on the betrayal that they had to go through.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSEM-hJF_vM[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4) Sunshine (2007)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.2</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Danny Boyle</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Cillian Murphy, Chris Evans, Rosa Byrne </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2588 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-min-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Sci-fi/Horror/Thriller made by Danny Boyle. Danny Boyle attempts to master yet another genre with this future based movie. With the year 2057 and the earth colder than warmer, a group of scientists is given the task of attempting to restart the sun. Yes, you read that right, the dying star has to be restarted and things do not go according to the plan. Not an action flick, Danny Boyle masters the direction with a wonderfully scary movie that should definitely be seen by Sci-Fi fans.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8BSlqHAhuY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3) Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.5</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Edgar White</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Chris Evans, Aubrey Plaza</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2587 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-min-1.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Action and Comedy. What a combination right? But that is exactly what Scott Pilgrim and his adventure bring to the table. Scott Pilgrim falls in love but the minor problem about falling in love with Romano is all of her exes. In order to woo her, he has to get through all of her exes.

Although, this one is completely different. The Earth has its second Ice Age and the survivors are not so many. Everyone is aboard a luxury train that moves through the snow and ice ploughing through ahead. And just like so many parts of the present world, there is a separation between the rich and poor. Until the poor decide to revolt and rise and attempt to take over the Engine Room.

In the midst of the trending Sushant Singh Suicide case, a piece of information has made it to the news. The news is about the Nawab of Bollywood Mr. Saif and charming Arjun Kapoor coming together in a movie.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2600 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-min-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"‘Bhoot Police’, A Horror-Comedy Saif Ali Khan and Arjun Kapoor\" width=\"564\" height=\"473\" />\r\n<h2><b>Bhoot Police Upcoming Bollywood Horror-Comedy </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, both actors are working together in this adventure-horror-comedy Bollywood movie. Fans are too excited for their duo on screen but there was also some trolling on this news. But the Director of the movie</span> <b>Pawan Kripalani</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is very excited about this news. He says that it is officially declared that both the actors will come together on screens.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also said that both Arjun and Saif have perfect comedy timing. They will be seen in those avatars that nobody thought of previously. The films will roll out at the end of this year 2020 and it was pending from 2019. It seems that fans are going to love this comedy combo.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Let\'s Know A Little About Saif Ali Khan and Arjun Kapoor</b></h2>\r\n<h2><b>Arjun Kapoor in Bhoot Police:</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the recent five years, Arjun Kapoor has done approximately ten movies out of which some have become successful. And some of the movies have worked out very less to connect with the fans. So Arjun Kapoor has become a sort of On and Off actor in the recent few years.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2601 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-min-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"Arjun Kapoor\" width=\"564\" height=\"473\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the blockbuster Bollywood movie Half Girlfriend (based on Chetan Bhagat’s book), his graph in terms of connecting with his fans through the Bollywood screen has turned out low. Unless he did a variety of roles like he played SadashivRao Bhau in the epic movie</span> <b>Panipat</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and he was praised for his character. Before that, he played a comedy role with his family member</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Kapoor\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <b>Anil Kapoor</b></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the movie </span><b>Mubarakan</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Though the film did not earn much fame as comedy movies do.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After this movie, Arjun Kapoor was badly hit with trauma when her mother </span><b>Shri Sridevi</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> died. It was a hard time for Arjun and in recent times he was too trolled for Nepotism factor after Sushant Rajput’s death.</span>\r\n<h4><b>Upcoming Movie \"Bhoot Police\" of Arjun Kapoor:</b></h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking about the recent times Arjun has resumed shooting for his untitled romantic movie with </span><b>Rakulpreet Singh. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This will also showcase </span><b>John Abraham</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><b>Aditya Rao Hydari</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It seems that he was very excited to return back to shooting and he was wrapping up his movie shoot under strict COVID-19  Guidelines. A piece of hot news has come up in between that Arjun Kapoor was approached for the next project of Shahrukh Khan’s production house company.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Let Have a Look on Mr. Nawab Saif Ali Khan</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking about Saif Ali Khan, he has done a lot of films in recent years but most of them did not work well. Unless he did </span><b>Tanhaji </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which was a huge blockbuster in the screens, and Saif played the Central Villian Character in the movie.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2380 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-min-16.jpg\" alt=\"Tanhaji Saif Ali Khan\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saif is known for his dynamic roles and his upcoming movies will also show a dynamic character of him. His upcoming movies are </span><b>Bunty and Babli 2 </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(sequel of Bunty and Babli) and </span><b>Bhoot Police</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saif has shown his appearance in five Hindi films in the year 2020 out of which the most loved ones are Tanhaji and </span><b>Dil Bechara</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n<h4><b>Trolling Times:</b></h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a recent few days, Saif Ali Khan has been a favorite name for the trollers. Saif was trolled twice on two matters, first for the statement he made that he was too a victim of Nepotism and faced Nepotism in his early days. Secondly, it was when Saif announced on a social media platform that</span><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/saif-ali-khan-said-about-his-autobiography-reactions-on-twitter/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he is going to release a film that will be his biopic</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Despite all these negativity by trolls, Saif has something to cherish about as he is expecting his second baby soon.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that’s it, hope you like the content.

He usually outshines other cast members in ensemble cast movies such as The Avengers or The Cabin In the Woods. Similarly, the talented actor stands apart in this flick, Bad Times at El Royale. It is one of the best movies of Chris Hemsworth, but again in a cameo role. As is usually the case in ensemble cast movies, not all the noteworthy actors get enough screen-time. But it’s their brilliance to shine in that tiny time slot allotted to their character.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Watch Trailer:</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7wzBVARwaU[/embedyt]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie showcases Chris in a never-seen-before avatar. The film is filled with plot twists, suspense, and a pot-bolling thriller. It has shocking violence, out of the box twists, and a brilliant Chris Hemsworth playing the character of Billy Lee. This film is a perfect ode to Agatha Christie and her fans. A must watch!</span>\r\n<h2><b>8) Star Trek (2009)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.9</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: J.J.

Again a very short role for the actor, he provided a very important arc for the Star Trek franchise. Also, little did fans knew that the guy who played George Kirk in Star Trek would one day go on to become the King of Asgard, in the biggest cinematic Universe of all time!</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKFUZ10Wmbw[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>7) Men In Black: International (2019)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 5.6</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: F.

Fans were disappointed by the fact that they won’t be seeing their favourite superstar Will Smith in action. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It did not reach a significant amount as expected at the box office and met with pretty negative reviews. But still, the reason why we are including it on our list is because of the range of variety the actor posses.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Watch Trailer:</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3lJwV7ZIIk[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the fact that he became the first actor to work in more than three movie franchises. The actor has worked in Star Trek, Thor, Avengers, and MIB. This certainly makes him a hotshot and tells the fact that he is considered one of the best action stars of the modern era!</span>\r\n<h2><b>6) In The Heart Of The Sea (2015)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 6.9</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Ron Howard</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chrishemsworth/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chris Hemsworth</a>, Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2152 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12-min-2.jpg\" alt=\"In the Heart of Sea(2015) IMDb - 6.9\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ron Howard has done two films with Chris Hemsworth. While the other comes later in the list, this here embarks us on a very beautiful yet dreadful journey on the sea. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film is inspired by the events which took place in 1820, in England, where a ship sunk due to the effort of a giant white whale. The survivors of the ship put up a great fight with the whale and were 90 days afloat, without food and water. The story is also inspired by a modern-day classic, Moby Dick.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Watch Trailer:</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_n2CAhgPiA[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>5) Ghostbusters (2016)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: N/A</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Paul Feig</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Chris Hemsworth</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2621 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-min-2.jpg\" alt=\"Best movies of chris hemsworth\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the underrated performances of Chris Hemsworth that no one cares to talk about or even mention is his role in Ghostbusters’ 2016 reboot. His awesome performance encouraged us to put forth on this list of Best Movies of Chris Hemsworth! </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He is unwillingly witty, acts dumb occasionally, and initiates sparkling chemistry whenever he is on screen! The film is a great laugh for kids and they will surely love to see their favourite superhero in a light-hearted comedy role. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see the efforts of the actor as he delivers on his finest performances in a comedic role.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Watch Trailer:</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6hlkIlGFCI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4) 12 Strong (2018)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 6.6</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Nicolai Fuglsig</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Peña</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1634 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/12-1.jpg\" alt=\"12 Strong (2018)\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on a true story and on the aftermath of 9/11, Chris Hemsworth’s performance was to be noted in 12 Strong. The actor gave justice to the script and the heroics of US Army soldiers, who provided a vital piece of information that later resulted in the fall of the Al-Qaeda. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film is totally based on the desserts and outskirts of Afghanistan and showcases the bitter nature of those who sacrifice everything for the safety of their nation. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie was not received well by the critics, as the IMDB rating is evident.

Later he established himself as a bankable action star. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long before making his Marvel Studios debut with Thor, he did this horror flick. Something very different from his previous projects. He plays a jock in the film, but actually, he is very much likable and knowledgeable.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our opinion, he is the only jock in a teen-horror movie who received loved from the audience.

While one attracts audiences who like violence and guys getting beat up, the other attracts an audience looking for fun and entertainment. Hence it becomes very difficult to handle a project in which there is a cross blend of both the genres. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a very thin line on which the makers have to walk on while handling such contrast genres together. Talking about cross-genre blends, here is a comprehensive list of the top 10 best action-comedy movies which will make you awe in wonder and roll out with laughter. </span>\r\n<h2><b>10) 6 Underground (2019)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 6.1</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Michael Bay</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ryan Reynolds</a>, Mélanie Laurent, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2639 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-min-3.jpg\" alt=\"Action-Comedy Movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can we start the list of action-comedy movies without mentioning the king of the Action-Comedy genre, Ryan Reynolds? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever since Deadpool, the guy has transformed himself into a bad-mouth ass-kicking hero. His role and attitude almost stay the same in every film, only the plot and guys around him change. 9 Underground is again one of the gems that Ryan delivered on Netflix. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filled with extreme chase sequences, a gripping story, and Ryan Reynolds at the peak of his career, you are sure for a fun ride!</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLE85olJjp8[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>9) </b><b>Bad Boys </b><b>(1995)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 6.9</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Michael Bay</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/willsmith/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Will Smith</a>, Martin Lawrence, Lisa Boyle</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2640 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-min-3.jpg\" alt=\"Action-Comedy Movies and tv shows \" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody thought that cop-buddy movies would be a thing in Hollywood. Although it didn’t set a trend, Bad Boys did enough damage to be declared as a classic! </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film is full of larger than life Will Smith and circumstantial comedy, as two cops try to find their way out in a crime-filled city. The budding days of Will Smith as an action star are a treat to witness.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm12NSa8jsM[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>8) The Hitman’s Bodyguard (2017)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 6.9</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Hughes_(director)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Patrick Hughes</a></span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L.

Another action-comedy movie and great Reynold action flick with a bunch of comic scenes you will not regret watching. Pair the great Ryan with Samuel L. Jackson, and you get probably the most amazing action-comedy ever! </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are uncertain when Nick Fury and Deadpool will face each other, but we got a small trailer of that moment throughout the film! The action sequences are pretty slick and comic timings by both the actors are phenomenal! Easily one of the best action-comedy movies in the modern ear!</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Afusxc2SM[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>7) Shazam!

And they chose Shazam to make the audience laugh. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the movie is more kid-centric and focused more to entertain kids, it does have pretty good action sequences. Even if Shazam is connected to the DCEU, it is a standalone film and is not related to any previous DC film. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s what makes it such a good watch as it is free from the previous failures of the Justice League. The kids will surely love this action-comedy movie!</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uilJZZ_iVwY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>6) 21 Jump Street (2012)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.2</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Phil Lord, Christopher Miller</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Ice Cube</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2643 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-min-3.jpg\" alt=\"21 Jump Street (2012)\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cop-buddy films have more or less always followed the trend of cross blending action and comedy genre. Some follow the usual drill, by pairing up African-American with an American or putting an outsider in the case. But 21 Jump Street is something you can never think of. A more comedy than action, the film focuses on two failed cops who try to reinvent their career by taking on a secret undercover mission. Guess what the mission is? To go back to high school again. Yes, you read it right!

It also followed the trend of the cop-buddy plot. Beverly Hills Cop is a classic and will always remain so. The performance of Eddie Murphy is simply outstanding and the circumstantial comedy will drive you nuts. If you are a fan of classic old movies, this movie is a must to check out!</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc3sPICXZLs[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4) Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.5</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Shane Black</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2645 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7-min-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A perfect black comedy of all sorts, the film has it all!

They decided to make movies, but couldn’t decide on the genre. Kick-Ass is a multi-genre film focusing primarily on the superhero, comedy, and action-adventure genres. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film showcased a world where everyone was obsessed with wearing a cape and acting like a superhero, but few people actually standing up against crime. The film is brutal to watch as the violence in the film is just as raw as the language used in the film. Just as the title suggests, this film is surely going to kick some major asses!</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rpXHqnGDXo[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>2) Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 7.7</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Matthew Vaughn</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Samuel L.

Again directed by Matthew Vaughn, who also directed Kick-Ass, this film was also destined to be a major success. Similar to what they achieved in 2010, Marvel created another multi-genre film focussing on crime, action, comedy, and adventure genres. One of the best action-comedy films of all time, Kingsman can easily crawl into your all-time favorite list!</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl8F-8tR8to[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>1) Deadpool (2016)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb Rating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 8.0</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Tim Miller</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Star Cast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, T.J.

Her ambitious nature made her quit the show and television altogether and go for bigger goals. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then decided to try her skill at acting on the big stage, Bollywood. Bollywood is not a kind place as all of us know and can be quite unforgiving so her taking this leap was one of a lot of guts. </span>\r\n<h3>Movies:</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her first movie was<em><strong> ‘Love Sonia’</strong></em> which was about<strong> human trafficking</strong>. From her early days, she wanted to be dedicated to the roles that she was taking on.

She was cast opposite a huge star in the form of <strong>Hrithik Roshan</strong> in the drama,<em><strong> ‘Super 30’</strong></em>. The movie was about the famed <em>mathematician Anand Kumar</em> who was played by Hrithik Roshan. It showed how he went from a budding mathematician with money problems to a teacher of great potential. Mrunal played opposite Hrithik in the movie. She was applauded by many for her acting by critics and viewers alike.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2653 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-min-4.jpg\" alt=\"MRUNAL THAKUR BATLA HOUSE\" width=\"564\" height=\"473\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then even acted across <strong>John Abraham</strong> in \'<em><strong>Batla House\'</strong></em> in 2019 as well. Her career has been on a constant rise upwards.

Arunabh Kumar created a small startup by the name of The Viral Fever Videos or rather TVF as all of us know about it. TVF tried to hire Biswapati Sarkar as a scriptwriter for them and Biswa was definitely interested. But he knew of his family background and their insistence on having a ‘safe and secured’ future.</span>\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwUtU8JF6Nm/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\r\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwUtU8JF6Nm/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Candid pictures of me trying to understand the Copyright and Industrial Design laws.

The name became a name that everyone knew. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the original audience that TVF was targeting which was the youth, was reacting in a very positive manner as well.

He started with content such as ‘Chai Sutta Chronicles’ in which he made his writing and acting debut as well. But his rise came as a result of a very different show that he created a bit later in his career.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He created a youtube show by the name of ‘Barely Speaking with Arnab’ which was a parody of the Indian news reporter Arnab Goswami. To say the least, the show absolutely took off. Finding fans and views from everywhere. The show kept growing and kept getting more and more views reaching as many as a million views as well. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if that was not enough, he then had guest stars on his show as well. And these guest stars were huge. By huge we mean people such as<a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/bollywood-actors-ranking-as-per-their-net-worth\"> Shahrukh Khan</a>, Ranveer Singh, and even in a completely different direction with the Chief Minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal being a part of his show as well.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where is he now?</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From rolling out constant hits to the pace of their popularity slowing down quite quickly.

Not limited to Bollywood, rather mainly a part of the Bengali movie and television industry, Rajesh Sharma has been a part of the Hindi film industry for a while now as well. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a career that has been longer than 20 years in film and television shows making, many recognize him by his face rather than his name. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what has been his career trajectory and story? Do you want to know more about this actor and his story? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read on ahead to find out all that you can about the <strong>life and career of Rajesh Sharma.</strong></span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career</span></h2>\r\n<h3>Rajesh Sharma First movie Maachis:</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rajesh started his career in the Hindi film industry long before being in the Bengali filming industry. In 1996, as a young man, he landed his first role in the political thriller <em><strong>Maachis</strong></em> which was made by <strong>Gulzar</strong> and starred significant actors such as <em>Jimmy Shergil, Om Puri,</em> and <em>Tabu</em>. The movie was based on the Sikh insurgency which rose in the 80s in India. The movie was a huge commercial hit. It garnered widespread applause for the quality of film making including winning awards as well. </span>\r\n<h3>Rajesh Sharma in Bengali Movies:</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though he did get a taste for the film industry, Sharma took a break from filming for the next four years. He returned but he did not return in the Hindi film industry, he made his return in the Bengali film industry with the movie<em><strong> ‘Paromitar Ek Din’</strong></em> in which Aparna Sen was the director as well as writer of the movie.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2709 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-min-4.jpg\" alt=\" Rajesh Sharma hit films\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a career that spanned across 3 decades, Rajesh Sharma is credited with nearly 100 movies which by itself is considerably impressive. He continued to make movies in Bengali as well starring in movies such as<em><strong> ‘Sathi’, ‘Shubho Muharat’, ‘Bye Bye Bangkok’ </strong></em>and <em><strong>‘Kagojer Nouka’.</strong></em> </span>\r\n<h3>His Big year of Film Industry</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rajesh has always made a large number of movies in any given year, having as many as 11 movies releasing within a year as well, which includes both the Hindi and Bengali movies that he would be making. While some people focus on just one industry at a time, Rajesh made his name in both the Hindi and Bengali film Industry. And comparatively, probably made a bigger name in the Bengali film industry considering the number of movies that he has made over there. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2711 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-min-5.jpg\" alt=\"Rajesh Sharma paatal lok\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We must also consider that while he is a very talented and bright actor, he never had any prominent enough roles at least in the Hindi film industry. Very often you can see Rajesh in a supposed ‘negative’ as we like to call it in Bollywood. While he has been a part of many great movies with many of them being all-time great movies as well. It is interesting to note that his role has always been one of a supporting character. The fact that his roles were so minimal in so many movies probably helped him be a part of such a high number of movies year on year. But he received such roles constantly because he is a very good actor as well.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several Hits</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even in the Hindi film industry, he has been a part of several hits. <em><strong>Parineeta in 2005</strong></em>, was his return to Bollywood after his first movie which as we mentioned was in 1996. This movie had a rich cast of Sanjay Dutt, Vidya Balan, and Saif Ali Khan. Parineeta was based on a Bengali Nouvella and had Rajesh Sharma in his return to Bollywood.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2712 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-min-5.jpg\" alt=\" Rajesh Sharma web series\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As his career progressed his name grew in the industry and he started receiving more movies in Bollywood as well. With 2019 probably being his most popular year in the Hindi Film Industry. He has done so many big movies like <em><strong>‘22 yards’</strong></em>, ‘<em><strong>Super 30’</strong></em> which starred Hrithik Roshan. He also did ‘<em><strong>Mardaani 2</strong></em>’ and as well as ‘<em><strong>Dabbang 3</strong></em>’ in which he was a Minister.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal Life</span></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2710 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-min-5.jpg\" alt=\"Rajesh Sharma biographi\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born in Ludhiana, Punjab Rajesh has always had the aim of acting in films and taking on acting as a career. He did dramas and worked in a drama group in Kolkota. He is also a graduate of the National School of Drama which is in New Delhi. Rajesh was initially married to <strong>Sudipta Chakraborty</strong> in 2005. They separated from her in 2009. He got married again in 2011 to <strong>Sangeeta Sharma.</strong> He has led a happily married life ever since. </span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is happening now?</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rajesh Sharma continues to make <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">movies and now TV shows</a> as well. Starring in the hit<a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/paatal-lok-review-story-actor-director/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong> ‘Pataal Lok’</strong> </a>which was released on Amazon Prime Video in 2020. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His career will continue in the manner in which it has. His smaller roles allowing him to make a large number of movies across a year. We hope for such a quality actor to receive more roles and hopefully larger ones as well. </span>\r\n\r\nHe is also an outsider in the film industry. He is not having a hero\'s face but with his talent, he is not considered in negative roles.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What have been your favourite movies that have had Rajesh Sharma in it?

Primer brings forth such a story where four friends “accidentally” invent something unholy, and find it difficult to deal with their own findings. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actor-Director Shane Carruth did a commendable job in pulling this one-off, although at times it may seem a bit predictable.

The biopic was based on Sanjay Dutt’s life and the allegations of him being involved with Mumbai Underworld. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film was made by the veteran director Raj Kumar Hirani and produced by his dear friend, Vidhu Vinod Chopra.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2835 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-min-9.jpg\" alt=\"SANJU BIOPIC movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film became a smashing hit as soon as it opened in theatres. Ranbir Kapoor played Sanjay Dutt and almost went on to perform his lifetime. His acting and efforts for the role were appreciated all across the country.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film received backlash due to its portrayal of the character. Many believed that the biopic glorified the mistakes made by the Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt and the biopic was just a reason to clear his name in some very horrific incidents in Mumbai. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These include the 1993 bombings in the city as well as two A.K. riffles found with Sanjay Dutt liking him directly to terrorism.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Bhag Milkha Bhag</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are wondering at which point Bollywood fell in love with making biopics look no further. Bhag Milkha Bhag was the first biopic of Bollywood which left a lasting impression on the audience back in 2013. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biopic was based on the novel ‘The Race of My Life’, by Milkha Singh.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2836 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-min-10.jpg\" alt=\"Bhag Milkha Bhag BIOPIC movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film beautifully captures the journey of India’s most celebrated athlete and the ups and downs in his life. He was entitled as the flying Sikh, based on his blistering speed and mind-blowing pace.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Farhan Akhtar did a tremendous job and cemented his position as a lead actor in Bollywood. The transformation he did for the part was just outstanding. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra directed the biopic.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Super 30</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking about transformations, this Hritik Roshan film will leave you speechless. Hritik plays the celebrated Anand Kumar in this biopic. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only Hritik underwent a body transformation, but he also changed his dialect and accent for the biopic. He took lessons for the Bihari language and soon after, gave a performance that left everyone dazzled.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2837 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-min-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Super 30\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biopic focuses on Anand Kumar, a brilliant yet poor teacher who started a free coaching institute for I.I.T. in Patna. He selected 30 students every year who were from poor families and taught them for free. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the big and good news came for him. All the 30 students cleared the exam and join the top engineering institute of India.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their struggle and hard work are shown correctly in the film, and for those who think something is impossible, this movie is a must-watch!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall I would like to say that if you are looking for any motivation and feeling demoralized in any industry then this is the best stuff for you. How you and go to Hundred from zero. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You only have an idea with desire and so much dedication, only then you can achieve the goal that is so unachievable for you.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Padman</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Akshay Kumar seems to have cracked the mantra of doing successful movies over a period of time. His new mantra, however, is targeting as many as biopics as possible. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He did back-to-back hits of biopics in Bollywood, and it all started with the 2018 box-office super-hit biopic Padman.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2792 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-min-7.jpg\" alt=\"Padman (2018)\" width=\"600\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film is loosely based on the true story of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a social entrepreneur from Tamil Nadu. Arunachalam started to make sanitary pads for women at a very low-cost rate. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At times were one sanitary pad was for 10 rs, his pads were for only 2 rs, and were as efficient as the branded ones. Soon his social activities were noticed, and he received substantial funding for his start-up after which he became a widely-known entrepreneur.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we have covered the top 5 best Bollywood biopics, here are some <strong>upcoming biopics in 2020</strong> which will leave you hooked to the screens.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Shershah</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2838 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-min-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"sHERSHAH\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siddharth Malhotra will do a double role in this war biopic.

We have seen movies and content made by both of them and there has been a lot of Karan johar and Anurag Kashyap movies! </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us have a preference when it comes to the two filmmakers. From the style of direction to the type of story that is written to the realism and fantasy lands that are shown. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The differences between the two of them are very vast. And we are on the side of preference for Anurag Kashyap and the movies that he makes. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking to get convinced to watch Anurag Kashyap over Karan Johar? Well here is our top ten reasons why you should prefer Anurag Kashyap rather than Karan Johar movies.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>1. Realism vs Fantasy</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anurag Kashyap has always relied on showing how the world really is, rather than a world of fantasy as Karan Johar so often does. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at the movies made by Johar shows a world that does not exist, with barely any realism when compared to the movies made by Kashyap.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>2. Gritty vs Hesitant</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anurag’s movies get as rough and tough as they can be. Watching movies such as ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’ shows us a rough and edgy world that Karan Johar has never done before. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karan Johar has always been a great deal more hesitant to show the roughness of the world as it is.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>3. Middle-Class vs Rich</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching movies of Karan Johar such as ‘Student of the Year’ one thing is very obvious. The movie shows the lifestyle of the rich. The life that is not practical for so many of us. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">W</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hile Kashyap’s movies such as the very underrated ‘Udaan’ show the life and world of middle-class families and how they survive every day.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>4. Type of Protagonist </strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lead of the movie is very distinctly different in the movies that they make. You could combine all the points we write and add it to the type of protagonist they use. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johar’s will be the perfect hero character that will save the damsel in distress and do the right thing. While Kashyap’s protagonist will be the real, conflicted character who wonders about what is right and what is wrong. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He shows his protagonist to be someone real and how many of us would react in the same situation.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>5. Outsiders vs Nepotism</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karan Johar has a reputation of taking the only star kids and not giving the deserving candidates their chance. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So many of his movies neglect the new stars who want to make their name and cast <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/nepotism-and-favouritism-in-bollywood-star-kids-vs-outsiders/\">kids of already famous stars such as Alia Bhatt</a> etc. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kashyap has always given priority to acting skills and gives debuts and opportunities to deserving people.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>6. Grounded vs Over the top</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karan Johar has movies that are known to be over the top in all aspects. From the action scenes to the dramatic moments. They are all well known to be over the top and not realistic.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Kashyap has a method of showing raw emotions and realism in whatever he does. He shows the grounded characters reacting to how many of us would.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>7. Dialogue Writing</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, where do we start with this one? What is your preference? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/list-of-top-10-most-popular-salman-khan-dialogues-ever/\">Cliche cinematic dialogues</a> or original quality dialogues are written that are unique to the movie? You know which to choose. We won’t decide that for you.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>8. Quality vs Commercia</strong>l</span></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kashyap has always made movies that give importance to quality rather than the amount of money that is made. In comparison, Johar’s movies rely heavily on revenue made. </span>\r\n<h3><strong>9. Open vs Conservative</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anurag Kashyap is definitely not afraid to show anything. From intimate scenes as they are, to the blood and gore that make a movie more real. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karan Johar and the conservative approach he takes to hold the movie back in several such aspects.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>10. Script vs Cast</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anurag Kashyap first has the script and then casts appropriate actors for the film. While Karan Johar is more reliant on the stars being cast early and building the movie around them. More than enough reason to pick Kashyap.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While both are definitely quality <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">movie makers</a>. There is an obvious preference on our part and we definitely believe you would be convinced by the end of it as well. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you agree or disagree?

It’s said that whenever Sanjay Ji goes outside for a shoot or on a tour. Then during that journey, he buys a cylinder, all the cooking materials and likes to cook at his accommodation.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multilingual Actor</span></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2890 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.jpg\" alt=\"multilingual actor sanjay mishra\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you are aware of Sanjay Mishra’s Versatility. But do you know that he is a multilingual actor?. Sanjay Mishra has worked in a variety of languages. Some of them are Bhojpuri, Tamil, Telegu.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of his famous films in the Telugu language is “Kick 2”.Some extraordinary characters portrayed by him are in the movies Golmal, Golmal Returns, Dum Laga Ke Haisa. He was also a part of the famous Hindi Tv Serial “Chanakya”.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanjay Mishra Work Over Family</span></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2897 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.jpg\" alt=\"family love\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attribute which makes an actor great is his dedication to his work. But Sanjay Mishra has touched the highest level of this attribute. I will share an incident with you listening to which you will be shocked. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Mr.Sanjay was shooting for a movie named “Baadshaho”.In the middle of the shooting, he was informed of the news. The news was about his brother going into a coma. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actor was shocked and eagerly wanted to see his brother. But at that moment he showed his greatness. He gave preference to his work, his shooting. That shows that acting is his job and he is fully committed to it.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unique Philosophy on Small Films</span></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2893 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.jpg\" alt=\"phillosipy of small fans\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might have seen many actors always wanting to do big-budget movies. Most of them try to avoid or keep away small budget films. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Mr.Mishra has a different take on that. He thinks that when you do small films then they provide you with handy practice sessions. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is like you are doing rehearsals for the big-budget movies. He also shared an interesting thought. It was that when you sign a lot of small budget movies then you have the opportunity to travel a lot. And Sanjay Mishra loves traveling.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Has a Never Give Up Attitude</span></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2894 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.jpg\" alt=\"police role struggle\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tragedies have been a lot in Mr.Mishra’s life. Do you know that after his father’s demise?. He was so in that deep tragedy that he left his acting career once for all.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And as an earning medium, he chooses to sell omelets in a Dhaba. People use to wonder why this man is doing like this, many advised him to continue his acting career. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But he did not change his mind. Lastly, Rohit Shetty somehow made him agree to work on his movie named ”All the Best”.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanjay Mishra Giving Several takes for his first acting shot</span></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2892 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.jpg\" alt=\"sanjay birthday\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the year 1991, when he was shooting for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanakya_(TV_series)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tv serial Chanakya</a>. Then a kind of funny thing happened on the first day of the shoot. On the shoot day when Sanjay Mishra was giving his first shot. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He did not execute that shot properly. And he was so into the character that it took 28 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">takes to take that one particular shot. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The takes failed because the Director had something different in his mind. And Sanjay Ji was naturally so much into character that he did those things that the Director did not want.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that’s it, hope you like the content.

They are introducing more heroes and villains, including another impending global threat by the name of Galactus. Furthermore, it would also bring more seasonal instalments to its showcase. However, diverging schemes have also been introduced over various platforms like Netflix and Amazon. So here’s my suggested five recent Non-<a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/whats-next-in-marvel-series-movies-and-release-date/\">MCU TV Series</a> that you can keep up with, outside the MCU, and keep the action going!\r\n<h2><b>1. The Boys (2019)</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let’s just put it out there straight - this isn’t your average family-fun superhero TV show. The Boys rather brings a dark adult content and a gritty and graphic sense of violence. Unlike Marvel, it has the trinity of Superheroes, Anti-Heroes, and Super Terrorists.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2975 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-2.jpg\" alt=\"best tv series ever\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The latter comprises a group of four ordinary people.

I have to say Achint Kakkar did a great job making this piece of music. Well, the graphics designer for the credits scene deserves a raise too but all that aside, let’s unravel what the hype is all about.</span>\r\n<h2>The \"This and That\" You Should Know...</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the famous Stock Broker <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshad_Mehta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harshad Shantilal Mehta</a>’s rags-to-riches life, Scam 1992 is a chronicle of how one can fall back hard if they rise without their feet planted to the ground. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frustrated from working menial jobs and his small house and a life full of compromises, Mehta decides to try his luck in the stock market. And sure enough, as you know, he makes it B-I-G.</span>\r\n<h3>Didn\'t you watch the Trailer, Go Ahead:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISORfez27og[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the high-stakes trading scenes at the “Ring” at the Bombay Stock Exchange or the smooth meetings that Harshad so eloquently pulls off with high ranking officers of the big banks of the country, this series has all to offer. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And sure enough, watching a Gujrati do business is already entertaining enough but when you pack that with the sub-plots involving the foreign banks and the then socio-economic portrayal of the country, it automatically becomes the phenomenon that this <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/category/series/\">series</a> has become.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3039 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-5.jpg\" alt=\"SCAM 1992 \" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The character of Sucheta Dalal, who busted this entire scam has surprisingly neither been portrayed as heroic nor villainous, instead, it is more of an anti-hero. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe that is because by the end the viewer develops so much attachment to Harshad Mehta that his enemies seem a little less heroic to you, but that’s just my theory.</span>\r\n<h2>The Cast Couldn\'t Have Been Better</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would be fair to say that no one could have pulled off Harshad Mehta’s character as Pratik Gandhi did. The conviction in his acting, the confidence, the Gujrati Factor, and of course, the looks which so closely resemble the real-life Broker have made us all believe no one else could have played it better.</span>\r\n<h2>Check out the best Dialogue:</h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYvr9RPfxlM[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A dialogue from the series “Agar Risk hai to Ishq hai” comes various times in the series. It comes particularly when he has to grease a bank official into doing something which involves a considerable amount of risk. The characters of Manu Mundra (played by Satish Kaushik) and Mr Rao (played by Mamik Singh) make sure there is never any comical draught in the series. What can I say, I can watch Satish Kaushik verbally abuse any day of the week and be content with it.</span>\r\n<h3>Check out, what the Ujjwal Patani Says about the movie:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXfEaJrZjqg[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notable characters such as <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cbi-former-joint-director-k-madhavan-passes-away/articleshow/73363574.cms\" rel=\"nofollow\">CBI Agent K Madhavan</a> (Played by Rajat Kapoor) and RBI Governor S Venkatraman appear much later in the series but I have to admit, they make up pretty well for their absence in the initial part of the series. Rajat Kapor has been just phenomenal in his acting. His part is very convincing, and keeps you on the edge of your seats, especially during the interrogation scenes.</span>\r\n<h2>Did I Mention How Amazing the Filmography Was?</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well now that I have seen the series, I am beyond convinced that Hansal Mehta (The Director) has a forte for the Urban Drama genre. His directorial supremacy is clearly evident in the brilliant character placement and the well-researched peek into the stock market that the viewer gets to witness.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3037 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-5.jpg\" alt=\"SCAM 1992 : Behind the Hype\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tension that builds up is quite subtle but you can really feel it as the story ends. It would be foolish to say that the series is targeted only towards the people in the commerce sector.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I have to warn you,  the first episode can be a bit heavy on financial terminology. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I urge you to stick for some time, as things will be as clear as a whistle by the time you are halfway through the series. I am a Medical Student and heck, even I could follow all the banking words and phrases(with a few Googles of course).</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming to Sucheta Dalal’s portrayal of this entire “Scam 1992”, I believe that she has been really honest in her approach as to why she was hell-bent on uncovering Harshad Mehta’s dirty business and a simple answer to that is FAME which she conveniently admits several times in the show. And I, for one, am not judging her.</span>\r\n<h2>If it Wasn\'t Clear By Now.....</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This series has its fair share of political sub-plots and to spare you the spoilers, let’s not discuss that. However, I am definitely going to mention one mysterious “Swami Ji” who seems to be the big guy pulling all the strings in the unfortunate series of events for Harshad Mehta. Without divulging much into the details of the plot, let me say that this series has been an eye-opener for me. I’ll leave the rest up to you.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an Indian, you can’t help but develop a strange sense of satisfaction and even develop an affection for Harshad Mehta. And why not, after all, he destroys the monopoly of various foreign banks in the money market and pumps huge sums of money in the stock market which makes the Sensex shoot up. He makes huge sums of money, not just for himself but also for the clients of his </span>broking firm.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sum it up, this is a power-packed series full of everything one could ask for. It has drama, comedy, tragedy, knowledge and the cherry on the top is, of course, the “Based on Real Events” tag. In Hansal Mehta’s Scam 1992 you watch bouts of pure Buearocracy with such interest even you will be surprised at yourself. And yes, if you can handle a few cuss words, this is the one to watch along with your dad!</span>\r\n<h2>Also, Read</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-bollywood-husband-wife-movies/\">Top Bollywood Husband-Wife Love &amp; Bonding Movies.</a></li>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-50-ultimate-list-of-comedy-movies-funniest-films-you-must-watch/\">Top-50 Ultimate List of Comedy Movies</a></li>\r\n</ul>','SCAM 1992 : The Harshad Mehta Story, Behind the Hype','','publish','open','open','','scam-1992-the-harshad-mehta-story-behind-the-hype','','https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-bollywood-husband-wife-movies/\nhttps://www.thetvfreak.com/top-50-ultimate-list-of-comedy-movies-funniest-films-you-must-watch/','2021-01-19 11:21:32','2021-01-19 05:51:32','',0,'https://www.thetvfreak.com/?p=3028',0,'post','',3),(3048,7,'2020-10-29 18:11:13','2020-10-29 12:41:13','<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Befuddled, bemused, confounded, and confused!. They have challenged the audience\'s intelligence. They made them question their sensibilities. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we look at the <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/category/hollywood/\">top 10 Hollywood Movies</a> that nobody understands. So, in case you have bragged to your friends that you “get” them but secretly don’t. Worry not! Your secret is safe with us.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>10. Predestination (2014)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We begin with the most recently released movie on our list. Starring Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook for the “most parts” (pun intended), this groundbreaking time travel sci-fi is based on a short story called <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13030110-all-you-zombies\" rel=\"nofollow\">All You Zombies</a> by legendary science fiction writer <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/205.Robert_A_Heinlein\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert A. Heinlein</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3074 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-11.jpg\" alt=\"movies like Predestination (2014)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethan Hawke’s character (known as The Bartender) is a <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/10-best-time-travel-movies-you-must-watch-right-now/\">time-traveling</a> agent working for a secret agency. As his final assignment, he must stop a terrorist known as the Fizzle Bomber. He detonates a bomb in New York City in 1975 killing thousands.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This highly complicated time-travel movie starts off slow but takes a very hard turn when you are least expecting. The plot turns suspenseful. Soon, you will find it challenging to guess the direction in which the story is heading till a great revelation is made in the climax that leaves you putting plot-pieces together.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a fan of the sci-fi genre in Hollywood movies, this film will impact you heavily. It will leave you thinking for weeks.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxG-YfedrfU[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>9. American Psycho (2000)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patrick Bateman (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Bale\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christian Bale</a>) is a rich New York City Investment Banker. He lives a superficial life of normality. But deep-down, within him, hides a murderous monster. At work, he spends time listening to music and envying his colleagues. Outside of work, he unleashes his repressed rage by butchering just about anyone, colleagues, women, bums, and even dogs.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3068 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-5.jpg\" alt=\"movies like American Psycho (2000)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie turns mind-bending when one of the colleagues whom he had killed makes an appearance in the movie later. It is at this point that the line between reality and imagination becomes blurred. The audience is made to wonder whether his heinous crimes are real or just figments of his psychotic imagination.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christian Bale has delivered cinema’s one of the most convincing performances as a psychopath. If you are a fan of film noir with a strong stomach, this gritty movie will appeal to your dark side.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YnGhW4UEhc[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>8. The Fountain (2006)</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3075 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-12.jpg\" alt=\"The Fountain (2006)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another one from Darren Aronofsky, this is a sci-fi cum love story. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz play eternal lovers who are destined to live in tragedy through their several incarnations over the course of three stories set in the past, present, and future woven together into one masterpiece of art.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie deals with the philosophical aspect of human mortality and the cycle of life. The storyline is nonlinear and the scenes and special effects are exquisite. At the crux, this is a simple story beneath layers and layers of artistic refinement and glorious imagery.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3069 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-6.jpg\" alt=\"movies like The Fountain (2006)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The performance of both actors can be described as remarkable. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz have made their characters deep and emotional with their hearts filled with love. The Fountain makes heavy use of symbolism and is not meant to be appreciated by all types of Hollywood movies audience.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8IlyFCbNZg[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>7. Mulholland Dr. (2001)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Lynch’s Mullholand Dr. is widely considered to be a masterpiece without anyone actually getting the point of this movie. This is a dream-like film that would carry on stirring up your thoughts long after you have watched it.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3065 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-2.jpg\" alt=\"Mullholand Dr. (2001)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mullholand Dr. is the story of a struggling actress Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts) who falls in love with a successful actress Camilla Rowles (Laura Harring). When Diane realizes that her love will remain unrequited she plans to get rid of Camilla by hiring a hitman. She consequently, gets her comeuppance in the form of deep guilt. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Academy Award-nominated movie has a top-notch performance by Naomi Watts. We suggest, before watching this movie you get acquainted with the filmmaking style of David Lynch by watching <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch_filmography\" rel=\"nofollow\">some of his other creations</a>. This movie requires a patient viewer. You will definitely have to watch it a second time for your mind to pick up clues from this movie to make meaning of the storyline.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbZJ487oJlY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>6. Donnie Darko (2001)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every movie has a fansite dedicated to it. This movie does and you can check it out <a href=\"http://www.donniedarko.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here!</a> Set in the small and simple town of Middlesex, Virginia this movie has a not-so-simple (or even linear) storyline.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3066 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-3.jpg\" alt=\"Mullholand Dr. (2001)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It follows the eponymous protagonist, who is later described in the movie to be a paranoid schizophrenic over the course of a month. In this period, he has visions of Frank, a seven-foot-tall guy wearing a metal-headed, skull-faced, rabbit suit that gives him the appearance of a demon. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frank guides Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) to avert the end of the world. As to why the world is ending, no clear explanation has been provided in the movie. Frank travels time by going back in the past and making Donnie aware of an event that will result in Donnie\'s demise while manipulating him to commit a series of crimes.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tone of the movie is very dismal. A lot of viewers have found this movie to be unbearably weird.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZyBaFYFySk[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>5. Pi (1998)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us are not good in numbers, but they speak to a few gifted individuals. We call them Math Prodigies. However, our next movie on the list is so incredibly complex that it was hard to pin down even by mathematicians.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3070 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-7.jpg\" alt=\"Mullholand Dr. (2001) Hollywood movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This debut movie of director Darren Aronofsky is based on a number theorist, Max (Sean Gullette) whose obsession with an apparently “divine number” leads him on a convoluted journey. Max suffers from paranoia and hallucinations making the line between delusion and reality very ambiguous.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film explores several religious and existential themes. When added to all the mathematics stuff, it culminates in a film that goes over most viewers\' heads. All we can say is that right down to its rather vague ending, this movie has something going on that has to do with the number Pi.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0SC582sJvE[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>4. Cloud Atlas (2012)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creator of the Matrix trilogy, the Wachowski duos are famous for creating ambiguous plots but this adaptation makes their other stuff seem simple and unambitious.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3071 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-8.jpg\" alt=\"Mullholand Dr. (2001) Hollywood movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud Atlas follows several groups of characters, played by Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, and others, whose lives seem connected especially since these actors play multiple characters across the tale.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether they are reincarnations of one another is somewhat unclear and the fact that some stories are referred to as fictional in the context of other segments leaves the viewers uncertain as to what is real and what is not.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWnAqFyaQ5s[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>3. The Tree of Life (2011)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hollywood movies director <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000517/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terrence Malick</a> is known for his symbolic style of expressing ideas. The Tree of Life is ostensibly a visual story about a man with the name Jack (Sean Penn) and his boyhood experiences.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3073 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-10.jpg\" alt=\"The Tree of Life (2011) Hollywood movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will find that this movie is interspersed with imagery of the creation of the Universe and the development of Earth with its sparse dialogues and seemingly random but beautifully shot footage. The Tree of Life is definitely an art-house film. Therefore, this movie isn’t for everyone since such films are often open to interpretation.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrAz1YLh8nY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>2. Primer (2004)</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3067 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-4.jpg\" alt=\"Primer (2004) Hollywood movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie left even the critics divided. Primer is a prime example of movies that nobody understands. All we have are theories. Even those can be difficult to wrap our brains around.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Primer depicts two friends. They invent time travel and the fallout of their attempts at manipulating the past. Typical time-travel mayhem ensues with multiple versions of the characters encountering one another and themselves as well as branching timelines.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Very little of the technical jargon is dumbed down for the audience. So unless you are very good in engineering terminology a lot of details can be really hard to follow.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3064 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-1.jpg\" alt=\"Primer (2004) Hollywood movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Shane Carruth as the writer, director, and star of the movie, you will find yourself watching Primer time and again in hopes of understanding it.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vD-yj9o664[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>1. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What to say about this movie that hasn’t already been said? Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 a Space Odyssey, the grandmaster of all space-travel movies. It is a work of science-fiction that inspired many Hollywood movies in the same genre.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3072 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thetvfreak-9.jpg\" alt=\"A Space Odyssey (1968) Hollywood movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2001: A Space Odyssey is one trippy trip through space. This film is in three sections. First at the dawn of man, next on a manned space flight, and lastly in a strange environment experienced by the last surviving astronaut of the space journey. All these are connected by a mysterious monolith.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR_e9y-bka0[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, This movie tells you its story primarily through visuals and music. That\'s why it is very thematically driven rather than story-driven though the middle is fairly straightforward.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, This masterpiece is absolutely captivating from its beginning to its surreal and grandiose end. It deserves the top spot on our list of top 10 Hollywood Movies that nobody understands.</span>\r\n<blockquote><b>- Abhishek Tewari</b></blockquote>\r\n<h2><strong>Also Read:</strong></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-sports-movies-based-on-real-life-stories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Best Sports Movies Based on Real Life Stories</a></li>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/science-and-mathematics-movies-based-on-real-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 13 Movies like Hidden Figures Based on Real Life</a></li>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-real-life-movies-based-on-entrepreneurs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">11 Entrepreneur Movie like Steve jobs Based on Real Life</a></li>\r\n</ul>','Top 10 Hollywood Movies that nobody understands.','','publish','open','open','','top-10-hollywood-movies-that-nobody-understands','','\nhttps://www.thetvfreak.com/10-best-time-travel-movies-you-must-watch-right-now/','2021-01-09 11:20:41','2021-01-09 05:50:41','',0,'https://www.thetvfreak.com/?p=3048',0,'post','',0),(3084,8,'2020-10-31 21:12:49','2020-10-31 15:42:49','<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We often look for an escape from our boring and mundane lives. Be honest, how often do you curse your 9-to-5 job. You wish you led a more adventurous life, right? So you open your device and look for one of those James Bond classics. The foreign locations, the women, the booze, and of course the cars you see have you hating your life even more. But the matter of fact is that the lives of actual spies aren’t all that glamorous.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So naturally, you go on looking for some real-life thrilling spy movies and that lands you here. Let me introduce you to these top 5 real-life spy movies. These <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">movies</a> will keep you on the edge of your seats. And yes, you can thank me later</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Munich (2015)</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IMDb: 7.5/10</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the gut-wrenching story of Israeli MOSSAD spies who were a part of an operation so massive and dangerous that it had to be named “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wrath_of_God\" rel=\"nofollow\">Operation Wrath of God</a>.”</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3092 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-6.jpg\" alt=\"Munich (2015)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1972 Olympics massacre of 11 Olympians from the Israel Team left the entire country and the whole world shook. The terrorist group Black September was responsible.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Promising to take revenge, the Israel Government sends their deadly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad\" rel=\"nofollow\">MOSSAD</a> spies on a manhunt for those responsible. TWENTY YEARS! The MOSSAD hunted the Palestinian Terrorist Group for twenty-whole-years until almost everyone who had a hand in the attack was dead.</span>\r\n<h3>What\'s so Different?</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie keeps us hooked to the screens as the modus operandi of the Israeli’s is something to watch. The novel ways and means by which they avenge their fallen countrymen are striking indeed! Buying information, killing for information, or not bothering at all and just killing, this movie packs a punch!</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LFfT44BlaQ[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie also portrays how difficult life is for a spy. Not seeing one’s family for twenty years is painful. This cinematographic masterpiece by Steven Spielberg is the one to watch closely, should you blink an eye, you miss what happens, eh, I mean, who dies. This is one of the most-watched spy movies.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Argo (2012)</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IMDb:7.7/10</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2nd one from the list of real-life spy movies. I had heard a lot about this movie because of the three friggin’ Oscars it took home. Can you believe three! So, finally, I decided to watch it. And if it were up to me I’d give this film three more Oscars. Yes, it is that good.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3090 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-6.jpg\" alt=\"Argo\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1979, when the Iran-US tensions are at a peak, protests break out in the Capital City of the former, Tehran. Caught in the wildfire, the locals invade the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. They try to kill every American they can lay their hands on. Luckily, a group of people escapes the embassy. They lodge themselves in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador to Iran.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is a story of how the CIA sends an “Exfil” expert (abb. exfiltration) to rescue their men. Tony Mendez’s  (played by Ben Affleck) job is to bring back all of them unharmed. How he does it? He poses as a Canadian film director wanting to shoot in Tehran. The name of the film, you ask? It’s Argo.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch this thriller if you are….. No wait, there’s no “if’s and but’s” for this one, JUST WATCH IT. Yes, it’s THAT good. And side note, Ben Affleck’s hairstyle in this movie is something I’m personally trying to emulate. Eh, too much information?</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w918Eh3fij0[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002)</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IMDb:7/10</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you were an American and born 60 years ago, you wouldn’t need an introduction to Chuck Barris. But probably, you are neither of them, are you? That’s why I’m here to help.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3091 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-6.jpg\" alt=\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind spy movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chuck Barris was a famous television show presenter who was once a household name in the U.S. He had written ideas for various superhit TV Reality Shows and Game Shows and hosted them too. But here comes the twist. He claimed to be a CIA assassin. And this spy movie is about his life as an agent. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CIA had never officially accepted him as their agent. And hence you can see why the movie gained so much fame. But then, spy agencies are famous for not acknowledging their men.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barris’s character, played by Sam Rockwell, grows at a steady pace as the movie proceeds. From someone who is rejected by most women, he becomes the “ladies’ man” as the movie ends. At the beginning of the movie, Barris is shown to be feeble and shaky but oh boy! he transforms into this charismatic, sharp, and somewhat lethal spy.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWyLE7kjGrw[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one is a no-brainer when it comes to getting that dose of controversy you’ve been longing for. And don’t take my word for it, the ratings speak for their own.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zero Dark Thirty (2012)</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IMDb: 7.4/10</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you like movies with satisfying endings? If the answer is yes, you are definitely gonna love this one. This is the story of how a brave CIA analyst named Maya spends a whole decade tracking the most wanted man in America, yes, Osama Bin Laden. Interested yet?</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3093 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-5.jpg\" alt=\"Zero Dark Thirty\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maya (played by Jessica Chastain) is on a blood-thirsty hunt for Al-Qaeda’s whereabouts. She does everything in the books to get to her goal. Her resilience and determination often leave us awestruck. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, she gets her fair share of failures, but she just cuts through them like a hot knife on butter. From bomb attacks to bureaucratic hurdles, she faces them all. And did I tell you being an analyst and a woman in the CIA is not the best combination?</span>\r\n<h3>Famous. For all the Wrong Reasons Though...</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film also attracted some unwanted attention for showing some gruesome torture scenes. Some interpreted it as an exposé and some said it was pro-torture propaganda. Either way, it got some free publicity.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final sequence where they actually hunt down UBL(short for Osama) is the one where you hold your breath. And to be frank, the part where they dramatize the decade long hunt for Al Qaeda operatives is a treat to watch. Getting an insight into CIA’s “methodologies” and how they retrieve information is a mind-game for any spy nerd.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strong women, I need not tell you why you should watch and promote this movie. And yeah, for your convenience this one is available on many famous streaming platforms.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJFra3B9sbA[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bridge of Spies (2015)</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IMDb: 7.6/10</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is my most recent discovery in this genre. Ok so let me acclimatize you with the setting of the movie. The year is 1957, the height of the Cold War between the U.S. and the USSR. Espionage is at its peak. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agents from both sides are trading information, getting caught, killed, and being disowned by their respective nations. The threat of a Nuclear War looms over everyone’s head. In the middle of all this, the CIA catches a Russian Spy.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3094 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-5.jpg\" alt=\"Bridge of Spies (2015) spy movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funny thing is that the lawyer appointed to the spy thinks he shouldn’t die. Tom Hanks plays the lawyer, who convinces the Supreme Court to defer his death penalty in order to exchange him for one of the US soldiers caught in the USSR. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie portrays Tom Hanks as a prudent lawyer who is a master of negotiation. He is sent off to East Berlin to negotiate the exchange of the Prisoners on behalf of his Government.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBBuzHrZBro[/embedyt]\r\n<h3>Spielberg on the Director\'s Chair</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film has some very light-hearted emotional scenes and of course some bureaucracy as well. The part filmed in East Berin in the winters is such a cinematically pleasing experience. Film aficionados like me will appreciate Steven Spielberg’s way of shooting this spy movies. It alternates between parts where the lead is submissive to other characters and then suddenly he dominates. This cycle continues until he succeeds in doing what his government sent him to do.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will be honest, I am a self-proclaimed sucker for cold war movies. Sometimes, I wish I could get to experience life back then. I know it sounds a bit stupid, but imagine meeting a real-life spy. Sadly, they haven’t invented time machines yet, so this spy movie is the closest to the real deal. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that’s enough said about this one.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, so a few points to take away from this article : </span>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven Spielberg is the king of this genre</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spies don’t have the life they show in Bond movies.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are really really bad at history. And these movies encourage you to learn about some of the major events that have shaped civilization as we know it today.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kudos to everyone who has read this far. Happy spy movies watching.</span>\r\n<blockquote><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Article by Sarthak Sharma</span></blockquote>\r\n<h2>Also read:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/best-crime-movies-based-on-true-life-stories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 11 Crime Movies Based on True Life Stories</a></li>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/courtroom-movies-based-on-real-life-stories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Best Collection of Courtroom Movies based on Real Life Stories</a></li>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-11-terrorism-movies-based-on-real-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 11 Terrorism Movies based on Real Life</a></li>\r\n</ul>','Trust Me!

He also gave a glance and observed how Pankaj Tripathi used to deliver the dialogues as he was from Bihar. All this Vijay had to do to get that Bihari accent. He had to work on his body language also.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Vijay’s Words</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3105 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-3.jpg\" alt=\"Vijay verma movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h3><strong>Rise of OTT culture</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vijay in an interview says that OTT platforms are providing a great forum for the new actors to perform.

You would definitely say, “ What\'s the big deal? He is an actor and actors (celebrities) wear outrageously expensive clothes all the time.” But what if I were to tell you that the T-Shirt actually costs just 4000 rupees. Shocked yet?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranbir Kapoor has several pairs of shoes, each of them costing him north of 2 Lakh Rupees. How much is the retail price on them? Barely 12 thousand Rupees! </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So why did everyone and their grandmother began spending a fortune on clothes that aren\'t even from luxury brands, just Nikes and some skate brands? Let\'s break down the hype.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>SUPREME: WHO BEGAN IT ALL</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 1994 by  James Jebbia, Supreme was just a small skateboarding shop in New York. It was rebellious in its design, openly defying authorities and holding skate meets where a bunch of teens would do skateboarding tricks (and maybe vandalise some cop cars).</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Little did anyone know that it would snowball into a multi-billion dollar streetwear industry, thanks to its endorsement by the Rap Culture in Urban America. Supreme would release (and still do) their products in extremely limited quantities which made them highly sought after.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would collaborate with brands such as Vans, Nike, The North Face and many more which further added to its appeal. Add to this the widespread availability of Social Media in the late 2000s, this brand blew up like anything. A plain white T-Shirt with the iconic “Supreme Box Logo” which retailed for just $35 would resell in the aftermarket for more than $1000! That\'s over 72 thousand rupees for just a plain white T-Shirt.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just to give you an idea of how crazy people are over this brand, let me tell you that Supreme once released a brick for $30 (about 2100 Rupees) and it was immediately sold for a THOUSAND DOLLARS in the aftermarket. Imagine paying 72 thousand rupees for a brick.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>THE STREETWEAR BOOM</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big sports brands got to know the power of limited releases and collaborations. Nike signed up Kanye West for his famous Yeezy line of shoes. Later on, he was dumped by Nike and then signed up by Adidas where he would end up creating one of the most sought-after shoes of our time: The Yeezy Boost 350. People went crazy after these shoes. The $220 retail price went up to more than 10x its value in the aftermarket thanks to its extremely limited releases ( just a few thousand pairs worldwide !)</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgil Abloh’s brand Off-White has been one of the most popular luxury brands and it\'s barely 8 years old. Abloh blurred the line between high fashion and street culture and it paid off. Now A-listers like Anil Kapoor and Abhishek Bachchan don Off-White. Off-White’s insanely popular (and insanely limited) collaboration with Nike’s Air Jordan line fetched over 2 lakhs in the aftermarket. It just retailed for just 14 thousand Rupees!</span>\r\n<h2><strong>BIG CELEBRITIES NAME IN THE GAME</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next time you stalk your favourite Bollywood star’s Instagram you are definitely going to notice how they are just rocking a pair of New Balance sneakers and not some Gucci or Prada. And why wouldn\'t they, anybody with money can walk into a Gucci store and pick up whatever they like but you’ve got to have some real connections to get something that sells out in seconds (yes seconds!). And that\'s a much bigger flex.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus streetwear is much more comfortable than luxury clothing. Why would you walk all day in a pair of Christian Louboutins and blister your feet when you can bust out your super comfortable Yeezys and be noticed 10x more.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And let me make things easy for you, here are a few celebs who have embraced this culture since the early days and way before the hype began.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>1. RANBIR KAPOOR</strong></h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3206 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-10.jpg\" alt=\"RANBIR KAPOOR\" width=\"500\" height=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well Known celebrities for his massive collection of Jordans, his love for sneakers comes from his love for basketball and the NBA. He owns hundreds of pairs of them. Not many of you noticed but he even rocked a pair of Yeezy Boost 750s in the movie Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/7-bollywood-celebrities-who-underwent-a-dramatic-transformation/\">Ranbeer Kapoor</a> has been drawn towards street culture before anybody in B-Town knew what it was. A true “OG”, his sneaker advice is sought by Shah Rukh Khan and of course the rest of the Kapoors.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3205 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-9.jpg\" alt=\"RANBIR KAPOOR\" width=\"500\" height=\"700\" />\r\n<h3><strong>2. Diljit Dosanjh</strong></h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3208 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-8.jpg\" alt=\"Diljit Dosanjh\" width=\"500\" height=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do I even need to say anything about <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/good-newwz-the-tv-freak/\">Diljit’s</a> streetwear game? Well let me put it short, it requires courage to wear fanny packs around your chest when everybody else around you is wearing fur coats and dress shoes. Celebrities style game was way ahead of his time and see,  now everyone is following suit.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3207 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-10.jpg\" alt=\"celebrities diljit\" width=\"500\" height=\"700\" />\r\n<h3>3. THE ENTIRE KAPOOR FAMILY</h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3209 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-7.jpg\" alt=\"KAPOOR FAMILY bollywood celebrities\" width=\"500\" height=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the young to the old, men and women, famous or not, that family has some serious obsession with Off-White and Heron Preston. I just cannot name enough Kapoors(celebrities) whom I’ve seen wearing limited-edition streetwear. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And how could we even forget Anand Ahuja (celebrities) who slowly converted his wife Sonam, his brother-in-law, Harshvardhan, and his father-in-law Anil Kapoor into hardcore sneakerheads?</span>\r\n<h3><strong> 4. Ranvijay Singha</strong></h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3210 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-4.jpg\" alt=\"Ranvijay Singha\" width=\"500\" height=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he isn\'t an A-lister Bollywood star, celebrities, there’s no way I’m writing an article on streetwear without mentioning his 4000 plus pair sneaker collection. (He owns shoes that lace themselves, and that too several of them)</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yeah that\'s cool, but how do I get a piece of the pie”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, assuming you have the cash to burn and the patience to find the piece you are looking for, there’s nothing that\'s stopping you from wearing what your favourite star is wearing these days. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can Instagram some resellers like @vj_kicks or @marketplacebymainstreet and ask them if they have what you like. If you want to avoid the hassle (but pay extra in shipping and customs) you can always shop from overseas websites like <a href=\"https://stockx.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">StockX</a> and Stadium Goods.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest this niche is for enthusiasts and definitely not for the faint-of-heart. You just cannot wear a neon hoodie expect people not to bat an eye. But that\'s the beauty of it, you get people talking, it may be a good talk or bad talk, but hey!

Big deal?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, not yet. He recently became the richest rapper ever, overtaking Jay-Z by a whopping  $2.2 BILLION! Impressed yet? Well, hold on until I tell you that he is also suffering from <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/bipolar-disorder#:~:text=Bipolar%20disorder%20is%20a%20mental,bipolar%20disease%20or%20manic%20depression.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bipolar Disorder</a> and yet he is raising his 4  kids with grace. Now that’s truly remarkable. Let\'s find out how he reached where he is.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Struggle, But That\'s Not the Point! Kanye West</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost every rapper has struggled to be where they are. Most have come from poverty, so has Mr West. Most have done minimum wage jobs to sustain a livelihood, so has Mr West. Most rappers have struggled with drug addiction when they made it big in the industry, so has Mr Kanye West. Most rappers have had to deal with their fair share of violence, so has Mr Kanye West. Most black rappers have had the pressure of voicing their community’s plea for help, so has Mr West.  BUT THAT\'S NOT THE POINT.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3140 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-9.jpg\" alt=\"KANYE WEST \" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many rappers have gone from making songs about women’ bottoms and bosoms to making songs about God? How many rappers talk openly about their struggles with Mental Health?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many black <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/category/celebrities/\">celebrities</a> support Donald Trump just because they feel like, get hatred from their own community and yet love them back? How many rappers became <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-movies-about-billionaires-falling-in-love/\">billionaires</a> after running into neck-deep debt?  How many rappers announced they are going to run for president? (although he was late in taking this decision, that\'s another story). So, you see where I am going with this. Well, there’s more.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kanye Omari West’s journey began where most rappers’ journey ends. A big house, a string of girlfriends, thick wads of cash, and lots of prescription drugs, he had it all but that wasn’t why he came on this Earth.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WHAT GOES ON INSIDE HIS HEAD</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, the clear answer to this question can only be given by the man himself but here’s something he has shared with us in the past. He said he didn’t want to be identified as a rapper(although he was making a killing off it). So he ventured into fashion. His early day\'s collaborations with the likes of Louis Vuitton and Bape are now the apple of all collectors’ eyes.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3137 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-7.jpg\" alt=\"KANYE WEST wife\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He designed his widely successful line of Yeezy sneakers with Nike and everyone went nuts. Fast forward a few years, Nike kicked out ‘Ye ( his nickname) because he wasn’t an athlete and Nike said only sportspeople could have their own line. So he decided to make sure Nike regretted their decision (and they did). He moved in with Adidas and made Yeezy into a phenomenon and not just some cool sneakers.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding far beyond shoes, he started his line of clothing and accessories which surely turned some heads in New York Fashion Week and later on Paris Fashion Week. The tremors of his success could be felt. As I write this article, ‘Ye is working on adding an interior design segment to his billion-dollar Yeezy brand all while recovering from COVID-19 and Bipolar Disease.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erratic? Sure. Cocky? Sure. Unstable? Sure, but proudly Unstable</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His famous line in his song Yikes,” That’s my bipolar sh*t, ni**a, what? That’s my superpower, ni**a, ain’t no disability” filled our hearts with appreciation. Never before has someone in his line of work called their mental disability a “superpower” let alone even discuss it openly. Any amount of credits given to him for this are less. But wait for a second, did he call his condition a superpower just to shed the stigma around it or was it something else?</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3139 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-9.jpg\" alt=\"KANYE WEST wife\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bipolar disorder, or the “</span><b>manic-depressive disorder”  </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a condition that surely makes him depressed at times but on the other hand, it also gives him bouts of heightened cerebral activity in which he takes some heavy decisions ( and tweets them instantly) which he otherwise wouldn’t. And they end up working out for him. His tweeting sprees are famous among his fans.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He once tweeted that he forgave Nike for kicking him out. And the other day, when he said he loves Jordans despite having dissed the Jordan Brand in one of his recent songs. He has been managing to spread positivity around him and believe it or not, its the “manic” phase of his bipolar bouts that allow him to do this.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love who you are, Just Like “Kanye West Loves Kanye”</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know there’s a lot to take home from this article. So let me ease your job and tell you what I learned from his life in 6 simple points:</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one sets your limits but yourself. Not your folks, not your teachers, definitely not some strangers on the internet.</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find a higher power to believe in, doesn’t have to be God, but bigger than yourself.</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family comes first. Always.</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t be one thing in your life. You should use ‘and’ at least three times when you introduce yourself. For example, I am a doctor and a Pianist and a Coder and a Writer.</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life is too short to hate. Forgive and forget.</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You cannot live for others unless you love yourself.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<blockquote><strong>Article by Sarthak Sharma</strong></blockquote>','Why You Need to Hear the Kanye West Story and Possibly Emulate Him','','publish','open','open','','why-you-need-to-hear-the-kanye-west-story-and-possibly-emulate-him','','\nhttps://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-movies-about-billionaires-falling-in-love/','2020-12-25 17:33:40','2020-12-25 12:03:40','',0,'https://www.thetvfreak.com/?p=3109',0,'post','',1),(3116,7,'2020-11-12 10:52:36','2020-11-12 05:22:36','<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s that time of the year again! Time for carved pumpkins, spooky parties, scary parades, campfire story narrations, and of course, fright films. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we bring to you Top10 Fright and horror movies for Halloween 2020 approved by the board of trick or treaters. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/category/hollywood/\">Hollywood movies</a> are absolutely terrifying. Just the sort of horror flicks that will get you in the Halloween mood.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>10. The Nun (2018)</strong></h2>\r\nThis one is a good old-fashion ghost story. The Nun (2018) is another chapter in The Conjuring franchise. This movie is about a priest who go to Romania by the Vatican to investigate the death of a young nun. She is confronted with a malevolent demonic nun by the name of Valek.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3184 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Nun (2018)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThis movie has magnificent cinematography, a spooky atmosphere, good tension in certain areas, and a wonderful performance by the star cast. You need to watch this horror movie alone and in absolute silence, as it mostly relies on jump scares and the dialogues are sparse. Overall, The Nun (2018) manages to keep you engage with its great storyline and the way it\'s narration.\r\n\r\nThe Nun is the most popular movie out of all horror movies for Halloween 2020.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwAM5UnGd2s[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>9. The Babadook (2014)</strong></h2>\r\nIt is said that it is hard to be a single-parent. Now, imagine trying to raise a child while grieving over the demise of your partner. That must be downright maddening!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3189 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.jpg\" alt=\"The Babadook (2014)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThis movie’s storyline revolves around a single mother, her troubled son, and a book titled “Mister Babadook” that he pulls off the shelf one night. Essie Davis does an incredible job of playing a single mother and conveying the deep exhaustion felt by her character.\r\n\r\nThe Babadook (2014) is not for all types of audiences. If you are looking for jumpscares you will not find any in this movie. This is a suspenseful, provocative, and thoughtful horror film. This horror movie also gave us an original movie monster that was unconventionally scary.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5WQZzDRVtw[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>8. It Follows (2014)</strong></h2>\r\nJust like The Babadook (2014), our next film does not rely on blood and shock value to offer a terrifying experience rather it makes use of the psychological element to scare the audience.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3187 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-1.jpg\" alt=\"It Follows (2014)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nIt Follows (2014) addresses deep questions about the anxieties of teen sexuality and STDs as the story is about a teenage girl who is followed by a supernatural entity after a sexual encounter.\r\n\r\nThis is an impressively shot film featuring some creative wide-angle cinematography. The movie is further amplified by Mikah Monroe\'s performance in the lead role.\r\n\r\nUltimately, It Follows (2014) is a compelling horror film and draws many comparisons to John Carpenter\'s style of filmmaking.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkZYbOH0ujw[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>7. Evil Dead (2013)</strong></h2>\r\nEvil Dead is a remake of Sam Rami’s original film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083907/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Evil Dead (1981)</a> although with a very different storyline from the original trilogy. It is more of a homage to the 1981 cult classic than a remake.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3193 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-3.jpg\" alt=\"Evil Dead (2013)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThis movie has some of the goriest and most disturbing scenes performing without CGI. And proves that a bloody movie can be made to look just as convincing using makeup alone.\r\n\r\nThe story picks up 30 years after the original film ended. This time with a new group of teenagers visiting the same cabin and accidentally stumbling across the \'book of the dead\' that unleashes an ancient evil.\r\n\r\nIf you can stand extreme gore and want to see a movie that is creepy, visceral, and an absolute blast of gruesomeness then this is the one.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFDkpHCQz4[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>6. The Cabin in the Woods (2011)</strong></h2>\r\nShortly after Chris Hemsworth played Thor, he starred in this dreadful carnage of a movie that was an inspiration to several 2020 memes.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3194 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Cabin in the Woods (2011)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nWhat really earns this movie a spot on our list is how deftly it manages to subvert expectations and really isn\'t that the hallmark of a great horror film?\r\n\r\nThe Cabin in the Woods has a melange of every monster/fantastical beast ever imagined. But beneath this chaos of supernatural lies an elaborate government conspiracy, one that makes the whole thing feel like a brilliant love letter to the horror genre.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsIilFNNmkY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>5. Hereditary (2018)</strong></h2>\r\nThis is the sort of movie that people were praising and warning each other about in the same line. A morbidly disturbing supernatural/ psychological <strong>horror movies.</strong>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3188 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10-1.jpg\" alt=\"Hereditary (2018) Horror movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nHereditary follows a family haunted by the death of their grandmother but it\'s so much more than that. Not only is it extremely unsettling to watch, but it\'s also chock-full of unforgettable moments that will put images in your head that simply wouldn’t leave.\r\n\r\nThis film is a true work of art both narratively and visually. Despite its colourful setting, it gives you a deeply unnerving experience.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6wWKNij_1M[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>4. A Quiet Place (2018)</strong></h2>\r\nWho knew John Krasinski had it in him? Widely popular for his role of Jim Halpert from The Office, Krasinski has proven himself to be a versatile actor in the years since, but he took everyone by surprise with his entry into directing horror.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3183 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-2.jpg\" alt=\"A Quiet Place (2018) Horror movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nA quiet place takes a solid premise of a world overrun by blind monsters who hunt using a heightened sense of hearing. This movie makes masterful use of sound-design that draws you into the world of the film and makes you fear the slightest pin drop.\r\n\r\nJohn Krasinski and his cast, including his spouse Emily Blunt, all deliver committed performances that serve as the film\'s beating heart. You empathize and grow attached to the on-screen family and this attachment creates real and terrifying stakes.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7cc5t7tv8[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>3. The Conjuring (2013)</strong></h2>\r\nAfter unleashing not one but two major horror franchises upon the world, we have Saw and Insidious franchise filmmaker James Wan deliver one of the greatest haunted house films in decades.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3182 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-2.jpg\" alt=\"The Conjuring (2013) Horror movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nUnlike most of the movies on our list The Conjuring (2013) does not necessarily feel like it pushes the boundaries of the genre, in fact, it is quite an old-school horror flick.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it so worthwhile is its attention to detail. It\'s an extremely well-crafted and wonderfully paced movie with great characters that we really care about.\r\n\r\nIn short, it\'s the perfect supernatural horror film, one with superb scares and a lot of replay value.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejMMn0t58Lc[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>2. Get Out (2017)</strong></h2>\r\nWe are definitely witnessing a new generation of horror flicks leaving their mark on the genre but arguably no horror filmmaker working today is more exciting than Jordan Peele from Key &amp; Peele.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3191 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Get Out (2017) Horror movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nWith his directorial debut, Get Out (2017), he solidified his status as one of the most influential voices in the genre. Completely original and terrifying in the most unexpected of ways. This movie delivers a scathing and profound social critique at highlighting racism.\r\n\r\nIt is also a tight craft film, expertly shot and well-pace. Added to that a uniquely unnerving ambiance and great performances all around. In other words, it’s a modern horror masterpiece.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRfnevzM9kQ[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>1. IT (2017)</strong></h2>\r\nThis past decade has felt like a renaissance for <strong>horror movies</strong> especially those centering on the misadventures of teens. Our final movie is not only the highest-grossing horror movie worldwide but is also a tribute to the teenage-horror genre.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3190 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-2.jpg\" alt=\"Horror movies IT 2017\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nIT (2007) is based on <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stephen King’s</a> (a.k.a King of Horror Fiction) phenomenally successful novel by the same name. In this film, Bill Skarsgard plays the horrifying character Pennywise, the dancing clown. His brilliant portrayal of the infamous clown is accompanied by the excellent performance of the film’s young ensemble.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCdOQsX5kc[/embedyt]\r\n\r\nRelying mostly on jump scares, this film delivered a sinister and looming sense of dread throughout its runtime and that is the reason this film earned the number 1 spot on <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">The Tv Freak</a> list of Top 10 Fright and horror movies for Halloween 2020.\r\n\r\n<b>– Abhishek Tewari</b>','Top 10 Best Fright and Horror Movies for Halloween 2020','','publish','open','open','','top-10-best-fright-and-horror-movies-for-halloween-2020','','','2021-01-09 10:53:51','2021-01-09 05:23:51','',0,'https://www.thetvfreak.com/?p=3116',0,'post','',0),(3146,7,'2020-11-11 10:32:12','2020-11-11 05:02:12','<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’d think that great movies make up for an easy viewing experience but you would be wrong. There are a lot of filmmakers in Hollywood that make outstanding films. However, only a few make ones that are both outstanding and difficult to watch. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we are looking at <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-hollywood-movies-that-nobody-understands/\">Hollywood</a> Top 10 Emotional and sad Movies. These movies are based on subjects that are actually emotionally upsetting.</span>\r\n\r\nThese <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/category/movies/\">movies</a> are ranked according to their subject, quality, and how they were received by audiences all over the world.\r\n<h2><strong>10. Precious (2009)</strong></h2>\r\nOur list begins with a producer known to explore themes that other producers wouldn’t dare to. Oprah Winfrey’s Precious (2009) is about the life of a 16-year-old girl. A girl who is raped by her father and becomes pregnant on two separate occasions.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3167 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Precious (2009)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She soon delivers a baby who is suffering from Down’s Syndrome. Precious’ malevolent mother uses her and her child to receive welfare from the State.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie becomes further unsettling when Precious learns that she has contracted HIV from her father. Although the movie has an uplifting climax the preceding two hours make for an extremely upsetting tale.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film has stellar performances and a disturbingly realistic portrayal of abuse and poverty.  Precious bagged two Academy Awards in the category of Best Actress in a Supporting Role and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urFY3jp759c[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>9. House of Sand and Fog (2003)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next is an outstanding yet not-so-popular movie.  House of Sand and Fog (2003) stars Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly in the lead roles.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3168 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-1.jpg\" alt=\"House of Sand and Fog (2003)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThis film is about two parties battling for control of a house and the destruction of the various lives involved<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>This chaos culminates into a depressing climax where we bear witness to the suicides of an Iranian couple.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie is based on the New York Times Bestseller novel with the same name by author Andre Dubus III. What’s remarkable about this novel is that it has an even darker climax compared to the movie. Needless to say, House of Sand and Fog is a difficult watch and a difficult read.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9_vNEfR7VM[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>8. Sophie\'s Choice (1982)</strong></h2>\r\nUnlike our previous entry on the list, this is a widely popular movie. In fact, so popular that even those who haven\'t seen the film are well aware of what it involves.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3169 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie\'s Choice (1982)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of a mother being forced to condemn her child to death is the central theme of the movie that makes up for an extremely difficult scene to watch.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meryl Streep delivers a mesmerizing Academy Academy winning performance in the movie. It is said that Sophie\'s Choice(1982) is a realistic, emotionally devastating, and memorable film.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STPJVf6wqCk[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>7. Grave of the Fireflies (1988)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an animated movie. However, its effect on viewers is so profound that we couldn’t afford to exclude it from our list.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3170 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-1.jpg\" alt=\"Grave of the Fireflies (1988)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grave of the Fireflies (1988) is a harrowing and realistic look into Japanese life at the end of World War II. The movie begins with the traumatic scene where a young boy starves to death. From there on, the film jumps in past and shows us, in excruciating detail, the slow descent into desperation and finally the deaths of our protagonist brother &amp; sister, Seita and Setsuko.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is often considered to be one of the greatest anti-war films ever made due to its overwhelming depiction of innocent lives caught in the cross-fire. This is the best movie from the list of Hollywood emotional Movies.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vPeTSRd580[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>6.

The Boy in Striped Pajamas (2008)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Movies concerning the Holocaust are generally upsetting to watch and The Boy in Striped Pajamas (2008) is no exception to that.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3173 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This story follows a German boy named Bruno (Asa Butterfield) who befriends a Jewish boy named Shmuel from a concentration camp.

Requiem for a Dream (2000)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps this is the most consistently depressing film on the list.

Consider <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?utm_campaign=homeAdvegas1?\" rel=\"nofollow\">COVID-19</a>, for instance, one virus that hit the world so fast and hard that everything became topsy-turvy. The situation turned haywire and beyond our control in the blink of an eye. As bad as it may seem, it could have been worse. If you don’t believe that, allow us to change your mind. You’d be thankful that these Pandemic/ Epidemic are fictional as we take you through our list of Top 10 Pandemic/ Epidemic Movies.\r\n<h2><strong>10. Pontypool (2008)</strong></h2>\r\nOur list begins with the strangest if not, the deadliest virus Hollywood has ever produced. An outbreak affects a small town of Ontario brought about by a virus so unusual that all it needs to spread are words!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3222 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-4.jpg\" alt=\"Pontypool (2008) Pandemic/ Epidemic Movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nPontypool (2008) has a slow but suspenseful first half where we are introduced to a radio host and his team that is airing a radio program.\r\n\r\nSoon reports channel through about some bizarre events taking place in the town. The second half is when the mystery begins to unfold, and we find our protagonists struggling to save their lives.\r\n\r\nThe film\'s intelligent script and top-notch acting by Stephen McHattie keep the audience on the edge of their seats. At times hilarious but altogether suspenseful, this movie offers a fresh look at the genre of pandemic/ epidemic movies.\r\n<h2><strong>9. Cabin Fever (2002)</strong></h2>\r\nEli Roth is known for making <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">movies</a> that are gory, bloody, scary, and crazy. All those at the same time and Cabin Fever (2002) is not an exception.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3224 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-3.jpg\" alt=\"Cabin Fever (2002) Pandemic/ Epidemic Movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThe movie is about five college kids that visit a cabin in the woods to enjoy a vacation. Little did they know that their idea of a get-away will soon turn into a nightmare when they come in contact with a deadly flesh-eating bacterium.\r\n\r\nThe story is well-developed and is a change from Roth\'s usual slasher-films. The acting is appreciable considering that the star cast was a group of new actors. If you have liked movies like Hostel, Evil Dead, Last House on the Left, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you will love this movie.\r\n<h2><strong>8. REC (2007)</strong></h2>\r\nA virus that turns ordinary people into savage killers is terrible, isn’t it? Now imagine being trapped inside a sealed-off building with the infected ones. That is stuff from a nightmare!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3225 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-3.jpg\" alt=\"REC (2007) Pandemic/ Epidemic Movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThe movie starts with Reporter Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) and her associate Pablo. They follow a group of firefighters into a building on a routine call. The last thing they expected to face there was the fallout of a rabies-like virus. This virus was a result of an enzyme that turned the building inhabitants into zombies running amok. This movie is one of the best from Pandemic/ Epidemic Movies.\r\n\r\nShaky camera movements. Constant feeling of claustrophobia. This found-footage style Spanish film will send chills down your spine leaving you squirming in your seat.\r\n<h2><strong>7. Mimic (1997)</strong></h2>\r\nDirector Guillermo Del Toro’s science fiction horror film dispenses the same moral advice- Do not interfere with Nature.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3226 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-2.jpg\" alt=\"Mimic (1997) Pandemic/ Epidemic Movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThe epidemic in Mimic (1997) is spread cockroaches instead of any micro-organism. However, this is one of the examples where the cure is worse than the disease itself. Entomologist Dr Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) develops a cockroach killing insect to get Manhattan rid of them.\r\n\r\nThe bug eliminates the cockroach problem by killing them off although there is an unfortunate after effect. To everyone’s horror, the man-made insects mutate and become gargantuan and gain the ability to roughly imitate Human Beings in appearance.\r\n\r\nDarkness, rot, and masses of unidentifiable biological material are a common sight in the movie. The special effects used in presenting creatures are fantastic. The story builds-up a constant atmosphere of suspense coupled with a well-paced direction.\r\n\r\nThroughout the movie, you\'d be able to guess if any of the characters will survive.\r\n<h2><strong>6. 12 Monkeys (1995)</strong></h2>\r\nUnlike our previous movies on our list, this one is set in the not-so-distant future. The year is 2035 and a prisoner named James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to the year 1990 to stop a plague from spreading. A plague so malignant, it destroys the entire human population saving a handful that must live underground to escape its effects.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3227 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-3.jpg\" alt=\"12 Monkeys (1995)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nWhat’s scary about this dark sci-fi is that the virus was created and released on purpose. An army of eco-terrorists called The 12 Monkeys does so in the spirit of saving the environment. It was later that we discovered that 12 monkeys are only a red-herring and the virus is unstoppable.\r\n\r\nThis film benefits from its great cast. Brad Pitt steals the show as a lunatic with his memorable performance in the asylum. Bruce Willis gives a fantastic performance as a confused man affected by the psychological impact of <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/10-best-time-travel-movies-you-must-watch-right-now/\">time-travelling</a>. Imaginative, engaging, and full of possibilities. This Pandemic/ Epidemic Movie acts as a warning of what we could lose one day if we don’t listen.\r\n<h2><strong>5. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)</strong></h2>\r\nOur next movie is again about a man-made....damn it, people! Are you not listening? Stop engineering viruses! However, in this case, James Franco\'s character Will Rodman means well.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3228 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-2.jpg\" alt=\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThis Planet of the Apes reboots witnesses Rodman testing a virus-based drug on chimpanzees to cure Alzheimer\'s Disease. It’s a gene therapy that allows the brain to create its own cells to repair itself. It’s effective but only for a while. The problems start when a more powerful gaseous version of the drug is created that enhances simian intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe drug spreads rapidly leading to an ape uprising and eventually killing off 99% of the human race. Talk about side effects!\r\n\r\nAndy Serkis delivers a great performance as the voice to the leading ape. A simple terrifying look from an angry ape to their kind\'s full-out uprising against humans. Everything in this movie is thought-provoking and an emotionally driven thrill ride.\r\n<h2><strong>4. Contagion (2011)</strong></h2>\r\nThis next movie closely resembles our current COVID-19 situation. It is also perhaps the most believable characterization of a pandemic. With admiration from the critics, Contagion (2011) doesn’t have a single scene that seems contrived.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3229 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-2.jpg\" alt=\"Contagion (2011)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nA flu-like virus that is a hybrid of viruses from animals spreads rapidly across the world. The audience navigates the chaos resulting from this inexplicable outbreak as they witness a team of medical personnel race the clock to formulate a vaccine. How the pandemic came to be is not revealed till the end when the storyline jumps back in time.\r\n\r\nThis Steven Soderbergh movie has a multi-star cast including Academy Award winner Kate Winslet. We get the story from the perspective of different on-screen characters. The movie explores the pandemic in a realistic, compelling but non-sensationalistic way.\r\n\r\nExtensive research with medical experts and representatives from the World Health Organization is responsible for this movie’s gritty realism.\r\n<h2><strong>3. 28 Days Later (2003)</strong></h2>\r\nThe road to hell is paved with good intentions from well-meaning people when it comes to movie viruses. A group of animal liberation activists just want to free some hapless chimpanzees in this Danny Boyle\'s post-apocalyptic horror film. However, scientists have infected these chimps with a virus that causes uncontrollable rage.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3230 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/8-2.jpg\" alt=\"28 Days Later (2003)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nTransmitted through blood and saliva this virus quickly turns strangers, friends, and loved ones against each other. Society witnesses a complete collapse by the time protagonist Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital in London 28 days later. There are only a few survivors and hordes upon hordes of really fast-moving zombies.\r\n\r\nCillian Murphy has given a remarkable performance. This is the kind of movie that makes you feel physically drained.  It also sheds new light on the survival instinct of mankind.\r\n<h2><strong>2. Resident Evil (2002)</strong></h2>\r\nA common subject in many science fiction horror flicks is viruses.  Micro-organisms that turn people into zombies. Such viruses never lose their ability to spook the living hell out of us.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3231 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-2.jpg\" alt=\"Resident Evil (2002)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nResident Evils has a particularly nasty example of such a virus engineered with a benign motive to cure crippling diseases. As expected, things take a turn for the worse and the virus not only begins to kill but also mutates hosts into horrible monsters. And to make matters even more severe, it\'s easily transmissible spreading through fluid or air.\r\n\r\nThis video-game based movie franchise gave actress Milla Jovovich her most iconic role as Alice. It shows the world plunging the world into an apocalyptic nightmare. You know it’s a resilient virus when its movie spawned five sequels.\r\n<h2><strong>1. I am Legend (2007)</strong></h2>\r\nThis movie is the best among all above Pandemic/ Epidemic Movies. Based on Richard Matheson\'s 1954 novel of the same name, this movie also explores the perils of an engineered virus.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3221 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10-2.jpg\" alt=\"Resident Evil (2002)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nIn this post-apocalyptic thriller scientists genetically re-engineered a measles virus to cure cancer.  As an unforeseeable and bizarre consequence, ninety percent of the world\'s population dies. The remaining human beings turn into cannibal mutants allergic to sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe film makes your heart pound with action/suspense scenes coupled with superb sound direction. It explores the psychological effects of long-term desolation through Will Smith’s utterly convincing performance as one of the only humans in the devastated City of Manhattan.\r\n\r\nThis is our list of top 10 best Pandemic/ Epidemic Movies you must watch.\r\n\r\n<b>– Abhishek Tewari</b>','Top 10 Best Pandemic/ Epidemic Movies You Must Watch','','publish','open','open','','top-10-best-pandemic-epidemic-movies-you-must-watch','','\nhttps://www.thetvfreak.com/10-best-time-travel-movies-you-must-watch-right-now/','2020-12-25 17:20:41','2020-12-25 11:50:41','',0,'https://www.thetvfreak.com/?p=3214',0,'post','',0),(3244,7,'2020-11-19 13:39:08','2020-11-19 08:09:08','<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last 20 years have been very rewarding for avid fans of martial-arts movies. We can say that in plenty of ways, we live in the golden period of this genre and our list is a testimony to that.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we want you to take a look at our choice of the Top 10 Most Popular Martial Arts Movies. Films starring Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee indubitably stand apart that\'s why we will be excluding their <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/category/movies/\">films from our list</a>. </span>\r\n\r\nLet\'s begin!\r\n<h2><strong>10. House of Flying Daggers (2004)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The beginning years of our Century witnessed martial arts films that were created with a focus on elegance and style. Our first entry on the list is a prime example of that.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3250 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-5.jpg\" alt=\"House of Flying Daggers (2004)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is based on a cop called Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro). Jin is on a mission to trail a rebel group called House of Flying Daggers. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This rebel group has a mission to overthrow the corrupt ruling Government. His pursuit leads him to Jin meets Xiao Mei (Ziyi Zhang), a sightless dancer who could be a rebel herself and belong to the House of Flying Daggers.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We witness Jin\'s loyalty put to test when his love for Xiao Mei stands against his sense of duty. This is a beautifully haunting movie featuring some wonderful fight sequences. It is an action-packed movie while also being a tale of duty and love.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>9. Fearless (2006)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hailed as the last of its kind in the genre, Fearless (2006) features martial arts star Jet Li. He plays the role of Huo Yuanjia, a legend among Chinese martial artists.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hero who, in the early 20th century, had conquered a number of fighters from abroad in open matches.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3251 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These combats were a huge victory for the national pride of China. Li\'s portrayal of Huo Yuanjia is a tribute to Huo Yuanjia\'s legacy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the brilliant direction of Ronny Yu, Jet Li has displayed action sequences with calculated movements. This movie reminds viewers why Li will always be among the greatest in his genre.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>8. Tom Yum Goong (2005)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We shall cover Tony Jaa’s debut movie shortly. But first, let\'s explore the movie that solidified him as an important star of this genre.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3252 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Tom Yum Goong (2005), Jaa plays the role of Kham, a man entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the elephants of Thailand\'s King. However, a corrupt politician, having connections with the underworld, takes away one royal elephant. Kham\'s search for his tusked friend leads him to the main city where he uses his martial arts to cracks the enemy\'s skulls and breaks their bones.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is rife with remarkable jaw-dropping action and stunts. You can see a full-on display of Tony Jaa’s mastery of Muay Thai.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>7. Ong Bak (2003)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tony Jaa launched himself in the martial arts movie world with his debut film that delivered a flying elbow to the head of the martial arts genre.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3253 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-3.jpg\" alt=\"Ong Bak (2003)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film has Tony Jaa playing a village man set on a mission to recover the stolen head of an ancient statue of Buddha. His mission brings him to Bangkok\'s underworld where his feisty Muay Thai talents are once again unleashed on the enemy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier, Chinese disciplines dominated the martial arts cinema. However, Ong Bak (2003) brought Muay Thai along with other non-Chinese Asian disciplines to the spotlight. The film\'s two other parts Ong Bak 2 (2008) and Ong Bak 3 (2010) explored the style of Muay Thai even further.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>6. Kung Fu Hustle (2004)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a movie by a very versatile Hong-Kong cinema personality Stephen Chow. This Writer/Director and actor of Shaolin Soccer (2001) fame and a catalogue of other Kung Fu comedies under the belt presented Kung Fu Hustle to the world in 2004.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3254 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-4.jpg\" alt=\"Kung Fu Hustle (2004) martial arts movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie is about a man named Sing (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Chow\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stephen Chow</a>) who inspires to be a big-time gangster. However, he gets caught up in the crossfires of a conflict between a local axe-wielding gang and the occupants of a run-down apartment. To the surprise of Sing and the gang, the apartment block is the property of a married couple who are retired Kung Fu masters.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie is an amalgamation of martial arts and special effects resulting in a cinematic experience that is breathtaking.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>5. Flash Point (2007)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While history drama forms a major component of cinema on martial arts we\'d be wrong if we didn\'t accommodate contemporaneous crime dramas in our list such as Flash Point (2007).</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3255 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this movie, Donnie Yen plays the role of a cop hunting a group of gangsters. This pursuit climaxes in a knock-down-and-drag-out fight between Yen and star Collin Chou.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don\'t have to mention that the movie, as a whole, is also quite brilliant but the final duel is certainly one of the most intensely choreographed showdowns ever. This fight sequence alone should make you want to see this movie if you haven\'t already.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>4. Hero (2002)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going back to history-drama films this next entry once again features Jet Li in union with director Yimou Zhang for yet another martial arts movie of epic style.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3256 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-3.jpg\" alt=\" martial arts movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story involves L\'s character as a swordsman with no name and the soon-to-be Chinese Emperor. The Emperor giving a conflicting account of Li’s victory over a group of murderers. Li states that his mission concern only the protection of the Emperor. However, the Emperor suspects that it all involves foul play for some reason.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie contains a number of beautiful performances and magnificently choreographed action sequences. They look more like elegant and brimming dance sequences than the rigorous showdowns.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>3. Ip Man (2008)</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3257 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/8-3.jpg\" alt=\"Ip Man (2008) martial arts movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our next movie has, perhaps, Donnie Yen\'s career\'s most popular role. The actor plays the legendary fighter Ip Man. A venerated personality in the community of Chinese martial arts.  A grandmaster of Wing Chun discipline. Ip Man fought off Japanese warriors that had occupied China in the 1930s.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film evolved into a four-part franchise that continued to narrate the tale of Ip Man\'s life and achievements. And this first installment from 2003 is where it all began.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is widely popular for its iconic scene where Yen engages in combat against ten black belts. Fighting all of them at the same time!</span>\r\n<h2><strong>2. The Raid: Redemption (2011)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few movies have punched the martial arts genre as strongly as The Raid: Redemption (2011).</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3258 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-3.jpg\" alt=\"The Raid: Redemption (2011) martial arts movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie follows one S.W.A.T. raid on an apartment complex in Jakarta run by a local drug Kingpin. Needless to say that the raid goes terribly wrong. The team suddenly finds themselves ambushed by gangsters. Their way out results in a lot of people from both sides getting awfully hurt.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The action in this film is pure savage and certainly not for the weak-hearted. This movie rocketed Iko Uwais to stardom and established a new level for spunky and savage martial arts action.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>1. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (2000)</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ang Lee’s celebrated martial arts epic overwhelmed the cinema in the year 2000 defining the tone for martial arts movies to come.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3249 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10-3.jpg\" alt=\"martial arts movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film is a true tribute to the Wushu discipline of martial arts. It shows two renowned warriors getting trapped in a net of conspiracy and deception after the theft of a fabled sword called Green Destiny.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The visuals of this movie require no introduction. This movie produced a series of brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and cleverly achieved wire-based chase scenes. Such cinematography is now incorporated in mainstream <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/category/hollywood/\">Hollywood</a> as well.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie bagged four Academy Awards including Best Cinematography as well as Best Set Decoration.

There is dialoguebaazi going. It has a very filmi music establishment score. It is a model spine chiller, a whodunnit. (This is about) A child disentangling a murder mystery of his father\'s death. It is extremely cool that way. I made some great memories shooting it.\"</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\'Bichho ka Khel\' is coming on Diwali. Set in Banaras, Uttar Pradesh, Bicchoo Ka Khel has movement plans, butcher, and bounteous proportions of contemptuousness. Every so often, it is difficult to not see Mirzapur\'s Munna Tripathi in Akhil Shrivastav, both played by Divyenndu Sharmaa. At the completion of the trailer, Akhil\'s character says he won\'t move away from the system, yet the structure will save him. Nevertheless, how? It will be known on November 18 when Bicchoo Ka Khel starts spouting on AltBalaji and ZEE5. He plays \'ichcha dhari bichho\' in the film. Ekta gets appealing stories.</span>\r\n<h2>Encouragement</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, a while later he has \'Straightforward Desh ki Dharti\', which is a sensational conveyance.

In 2018, we saw the Mirzapur storm taking wherever in the country, and since the time by then, the fan following has kept producing for the show. Featuring <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/pankaj-tripathi-biography-movies-tv-and-awards/\">Pankaj Tripathi</a>, Ali Fazal, Divyendu Sharma, and others, the bad behavior spine chiller was esteemed for its unrefined substance.

ShawShank Redemption (1994):</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb rating:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 9.3</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Frank Darabont</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Starcast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Robbins\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tim Robbins</a>, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Mark Rolston</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3305 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-8.jpg\" alt=\"ShawShank Redemption (1994):\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So starting off strong, I bring a movie out of all movies everybody should know about for its storytelling. Surprisingly, this is one of those movies that has never won an oscar for it. It depicts life not only in the most challenging way but also shows the beauty of life and what people should stand for in each and every way possible.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So a baker, Andy Dufresne, is sentenced with two distinct terms. He is imprisoned for killing his wife and the man she cheated with. These were actions that he never actually committed and he himself only knows that for the better.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has been sentenced to life in Shawshank State Prison, where he has to suffers unwillingly for the brutality of prison life. But through those years he was able to find his redemption not by escaping the prison (later on in the movie he does escape for his life) but by realizing that in the toughest and most gloomy of times, he has the power to adapt and persevere.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmzuHjWmXOc[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing is too difficult for the human mind and this movie shows human potential at its best. This masterpiece is only known worldwide because of the core life lessons it portrays along the way.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Platforms</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix.</span>\r\n<h2><b>2. Die Hard Series (1988-2013):</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb rating:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> -</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John McTiernan</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Starcast:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, William Atherton.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3306 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-7.jpg\" alt=\"Die Hard Series (1988-2013) should wen oscar \" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Die Hard Franchise is some of the well-renowned franchises of Hollywood, featuring a New-York divorced Cop, John McClane, who faces a notorious terrorist group, under the leadership of Hans Gruber.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first three sequels show how this single cop takes a stand against all odds and stack those odds against themselves, in an action-packed 80s classic. He fends off all obstacles he goes against and in the end, comes out triumphant. He manages to foil the protagonistic organization’s schemes, and always get the best of them.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Its first installment was one of the most well-set hostage situations for its plot. The amazing roles of Bruce Willis and of Alan Rickman weren’t seen as worthy enough to receive a single reward for the first sequel and the same can be said for the remaining sequels as well. In fact, the first movie actually managed to get a total of four Oscar nominations including those for sounds, editing, and visual effects.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5w1Imd66Eg[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was Alan Rickman\'s first acting role, and many of you won\'t know that he is well known for another role. He is actually the estranged and mysterious Professor Snape, of the Harry Potter Franchise. Another fun fact of the franchise is also that since the movie is intensely action-packed, one of the movie\'s scenes led Bruce Willis to suffer hearing loss temporarily on set.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Platforms:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Prime</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>3.

Their malevolence can corrupt the minds of the innocents and kill its inhabitants.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many before him, Jack Torrance decides to take care of this isolated place called Overlook Hotel in Colorado. He settles in with his beloved wife and his son (His name is Danny by the way).  As we take a further look at the story, we will notice that its premonitions intend to haunt Jack and his family. While slowly corrupting their minds they began to encounter all the dark secrets the hotel harbours.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cb3ik6zP2I[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Danny starts to have visions which become only more disturbing over time. Jack slowly corrupts into a homicidal maniac and starts to begin losing his mind. He even tries to murder his family! At the time of its release, the movie was recognized and even got nominated for the Oscars. But this was all to no avail and was lambasted by the critics, overlooking the movie’s intensity and eccentricity.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Platforms:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Prime</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>4.

He is known to be one of the best precision and rally car drivers from Hollywood. The first 12 minutes only show what the character is made of and how he deals with the pressure around him as he masterfully sneaks around and discreetly escapes the cops, while he escorts a band of robbers with him.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He later falls in love with a mother, Irene, who is also the wife of a criminal. The driver would then involve himself in a love triangle and people take note of how things get only worse from there.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBiOF3y1W0Y[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the production phase of the film, Ryan was allowed to pick any car for his character development and instructed to rebuild it.  He solely chose and rebuilt a 73’ Chevrolet Malibu.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Platforms:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Netflix</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vudu</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fandango</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Play</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>5. </b><b>The Harry Potter Series (2001-2011):</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb rating:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> -</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> David Yates, Alfonso Cuarón, Chris Columbus, Mike Newell</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Starcast:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3304 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-6.jpg\" alt=\"The Harry Potter Series (2001-2011): won oscar movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So I believe I should end this post with a bang.

This recent documentary features the founder of Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes, whose 9 Billion Dollar worth company came crashing down from the peaks of Silicon Valley.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The documentary entails how a Stanford dropout became a Silicon Valley visionary. What the world considered her to change the world’s health issues, turned out to be one of the biggest frauds in history. All her promises she made from inventing a blood analyzer, came out to beguile many investors and her failure stands out to be Silicon Valley’s biggest cataclysm.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Achievements/ Nominations:</b><b>\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Award - Outstanding Documentary (2020)</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> HBO</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><strong>2.

It features the life of once an eccentric billionaire named, Jordan Belfort, who emerges on Wall Street as a prominent stockbroker. The Millionaires movies unfold in showing the audience how he started, before his breakthrough. When he first steps foot in Wall Street, he takes an entry-level job at a Wall Street brokerage firm.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite his lack of experience and that only coming from working in the firm, he started from scratch and started making a name for himself. By the 90s and while still in his 20s, Belfort emerged his own firm by the name of Stratton Oakmont.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie then shows his prime how he spent in a spree of his well-earned luxurious life, while he, with his merry and hungry band of brokers, made a huge fortune by defrauding wealthy investors out dry. While Belfort and his band live the high life, the SEC and FBI come knocking on his door and try to stop him this gargantuan fraud that he makes time and time again, relentlessly. But may I suggest you watch these Millionaires movies alone, for the high life is too graphic and uncomfortable around your family members.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Achievements/ Nominations:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MTV Movie Award - Best Jaw-Dropping Moment: Leonardo DeCaprio (2014).</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MTV Movie Award - Best Comedic Performance: Jonah Hill (2014).</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Empire Award - Best Female Newcomer: Margot Robbie (2014).</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is known as Martin Scorsese\'s major commercial success, grossing roughly $392 million worldwide.

This is a popular subject for movies. However, only a few <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-13-war-movies-based-on-real-stories/\">War films</a> have been successful in capturing the realism of frantic combat. Today, we invite you to look at our pick of Top 10 Hollywood War Movies. Real wars and combat battles have inspired these films, and they have been praised for their authentic portrayal of war and its side effects.\r\n<h2><strong>10. Enemy At The Gates (2001)</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3325 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-9.jpg\" alt=\"movies like Enemy At The Gates (2001)Hollywood War Movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThis movie is based on what is considered to be an extremely infamous event of WW II, The Battle of Stalingrad.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O-sMh_DO6I\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enemy At The Gates (2001)</a> involves a man named Vassili (Jude Law) who rose to fame as a part of a Government plot. A scheme to eliminate Russian forces. Situations lead to Vassili almost losing his own faith as he embarks upon the challenge of his life. Facing a fierce German Sniper.\r\n\r\nEnemy At The Gates (2001) portrays war vividly and graphically. Director Jean Annaud explored subjects like love and friendship amidst death, destruction, and chaos.\r\nThe film constantly maintains a disturbing atmosphere of hopelessness. The combat scenes are short but when put together, the movie makes up for a fast-paced war experience.\r\n<h2><strong>9. Platoon (2006)</strong></h2>\r\nIt\'s no secret that director Oliver Stone is a war veteran. Not long after his tour concluded in 1968, Stone wrote a semi-autobiographical screenplay. This screenplay would late be the inspiration for Platoon (2006).\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3326 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-8.jpg\" alt=\"movies like Platoon (2006) Hollywood War Movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nOliver Stone was so meticulous when it came to recreating Vietnam that he made the star cast undergo army training. He even had red dirt imported to the movie-set location in the Philippines. All this just to get into the mindset of soldiers.\r\n\r\nCharlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, and Tom Berenger play US soldiers stationed in Vietnam.  Platoon (2006) is full of widely varied personalities and levels of morality. This is a harrowing and haunting war movie.\r\n<h2><strong>8. Flag of our Fathers (2006)</strong></h2>\r\nDirected by legendary actor/director/producer, Clint Eastwood and based on James Bradley\'s novel, it is one of the rare movies that remain true to its book. It explores thought-provoking subjects such as heroism and war-propaganda.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3327 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-8.jpg\" alt=\"movies like Flag of our Fathers (2006) Hollywood War Movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nSix soldiers photographed hoisting the United States flag on Mt. Suribachi in the Feb of 1945. Flag of our Fathers (2006) is a story following the lives of three of them. These three managed to survive the war and had flown back to their country. The Government later uses these new war heroes to sell government bonds.\r\n\r\nThis film deals with the aftermath of war rather than the combat itself sending a message, there are no heroes in war.\r\n<h2><strong>7. Apocalypse Now (1979)</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3328 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-7.jpg\" alt=\"movies like Apocalypse Now (1979) Hollywood War Movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nApocalypse Now covers the topic of the psychological repercussions of war. This violent and gritty story follows Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen). Willard is a detached military man in search of a mission. This mission later turns out to be an assassination attempt on a reclusive renegade Colonel by the name of Kurtz (Marlon Brando).\r\n\r\nMarlon Brando\'s character of a mentally unhinged Colonel does not appear until the film\'s climax.  However, both Sheen and Brando\'s immensely powerful and authentic performances continue to haunt viewers to this day.\r\n<h2><strong>6. Full Metal Jacket (1987)</strong></h2>\r\nYou wouldn’t see much warfare until the second half of Full Metal Jacket (1987). However, the opening scenes are arguably even harder to watch.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3329 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-7.jpg\" alt=\"movies like Full Metal Jacket (1987) Hollywood War Movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThe first half is about a cruel Drill Instructor (R Lee Ermey) pushing one vulnerable private over the edge of sanity.\r\n\r\nErmey served as an actual drill instructor in Vietnam and thus improvised many of his character\'s callous insults.\r\n\r\nErmey’s performance is not the only aspect of this film that\'s shockingly accurate. It is said that director Stanley Kubrick started researching the Vietnam War in 1983. He was influenced by documentaries, Vietnamese newspapers, and a plethora of photos.\r\n<h2><strong>5. Dunkirk (2017)</strong></h2>\r\nDunkirk (2017) follows a non-linear storyline like a few other Christopher Nolan\'s movies.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3330 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-5.jpg\" alt=\"movies like Dunkirk (2017)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nExplored from three perspectives, Dunkirk (2017) is based on a World War II event where the Allied soldiers from Britain and France were held up in the city of Dunkirk, France. Surrounded by Germans they made an attempt to evacuate during a raging battle.\r\n\r\nNolan is known for his rare use of CGI and this movie is no exception. The film had a crew of six-thousand extras, authentic vehicles from WW II, and realistic sets.\r\n\r\nDunkirk (2017) doesn’t have a lot of dialogues and relies on sound-design during most of the movie runtime. To put it shortly, Dunkirk (2017) is an achievement in war cinema.\r\n<h2><strong>4. 1917 (2019)</strong></h2>\r\n1917 (2019) is a unique film as far as cinematography is concerned. This film is made in a one-take style ensuring that you can\'t look away.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3331 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-4.jpg\" alt=\"movies like 1917 (2019)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nDirected by Sam Mendes and winner of three Academy Awards, this movie has a very linear storyline. The movie is about two soldiers who are ordered to deliver one message that will save the lives of 1600 soldiers who are about to march into certain death. These two soldiers must race against time to deliver the message.\r\n\r\nA great plot, wonderfully written characters, and fabulous performances all around. Needless, to say, every aspect of the movie is near perfect among all Hollywood War Movies list.\r\n<h2><strong>3. The Hurt Locker (2008)</strong></h2>\r\nThis movie created history! This was the first time in Hollywood that a female moviemaker had received the Best Director Academy Award.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3332 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/8-4.jpg\" alt=\"movies like The Hurt Locker (2008)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nDirected by Kathryn Bigelow, this action thriller follows a bomb diffusal unit stationed in Iraq during the Iraq war.\r\n\r\nAn atmosphere of smouldering tensions arises between new Squad Leader William James (Jeremy Renner) and his crew as they execute their operations of defusing bombs.\r\n\r\nJeremy Renner along with his co-stars make The Hurt Locker (2008) stand out on our list of Hollywood’s Top 10 War Movies.\r\n<h2><strong>2. Black Hawk Down (2001)</strong></h2>\r\nDirector Ridley Scott plunges the viewers into explosive anarchy and never gives us a second to catch our breath in Black Hawk Down (2001).\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3333 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-4.jpg\" alt=\"movies like Black Hawk Down (2001)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThis exceptional film chronicles the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu from the perspective of American soldiers. This movie is an adaptation of Mark Bowden\'s non-fiction book and takes gritty realism to new levels. It approached the US Somalia conflict with the finesse of a documentary.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most authentic aspect of the <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">film</a> is the camaraderie between our central characters as some cast members trained with real soldiers. This created a constant sense of brotherhood that shined through in the final product.\r\n<h2><strong>1. Saving Private Ryan (1998)</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3324 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10-4.jpg\" alt=\"Saving Private Ryan (1998)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nlast of the Hollywood War Movies list and best one. War is full of horrors and you can never be psychologically prepared for it. However, Saving Private Ryan (1998) is the closest you can come to having a war experience without enlisting as a soldier. In fact, the very first scene of the movie, the D-Day sequence proved so believable that some veterans experienced PTSD while watching it.\r\n\r\nFrom the seasickness to the relentless mayhem that ensued. Everything about the movie’s portrayal of the Normandy invasion on June the 6th, 1944 rings true.\r\n\r\nThe first twenty-minutes is what most people discuss. However, the movie also focuses on a squad with a mission is to find Private James Ryan whose three brothers perish during the conflict.\r\n\r\nThere is a fine balance between action and emotion in this movie. With its immense critical and commercial success, Saving Private Ryan (1998) occupies the top position on our Top 10 list of <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/category/hollywood/\">Hollywood</a> War Movies.','Hollywood War Movies | List of Top 10 You Must Watch','','publish','open','open','','hollywood-war-movies-list-of-top-10-you-must-watch','','\nhttps://www.thetvfreak.com/top-13-war-movies-based-on-real-stories/','2020-12-25 17:16:00','2020-12-25 11:46:00','',0,'https://www.thetvfreak.com/?p=3319',0,'post','',1),(3402,9,'2020-12-11 20:13:36','2020-12-11 14:43:36','<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mystery, Crime movies, and Thriller have been volatile Genres when it comes to all the movies out there.

The Green Mile (1999)</strong></h2>\r\nBased on a story by the master of horror Stephen King and three times Academy Award-nominated director Frank <span class=\"wo fr-6\" data-num=\"6\">Darabont</span>, this movie is a tearjerker. With a brilliant story, fantastic narration, exceptional acting, The Green Mile (1999) is an outstanding drama.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3447 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg\" alt=\"The Green Mile (1999)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThis movie is about how the life of a prison warden named Paul <span class=\"wo fr-7\" data-num=\"7\">Edgecomb </span>(Tom Hanks) changes when a death row inmate with a special gift makes an entry into the prison.\r\n\r\nThis over three-hour-long film keeps you riveted to your seat as you go through a roller coaster ride of emotions. It will make you smile, cry, and sometimes fill you with emotions that cannot be put into words. The movie ends with a very cathartic note making you feel grateful for the gift that is called life.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki4haFrqSrw[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>5. Life is beautiful (1997)</strong></h2>\r\nYou\'d think that a film in which a father and son are sent to a Nazi death camp wouldn\'t belong to this list. But you\'d be wrong!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3448 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThe audience is left in awe when a father successfully convinces his son that they\'re in the midst of a large game. All this to shield him from the horrors of their everyday life in the concentration camp.\r\n\r\nThe healing nature of this comedy comes from the fact that it takes a dark subject matter and shines a light of hope upon it.  Life is beautiful (1997) leaves us appreciative of the love of family and the sacrifices people make for those they care about.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CTjcVr9Iao[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>4.

This FedEx Depot engineer gets marooned on an island with nothing but a volleyball to keep him company. He undergoes physical and mental transformation but continues to fight for survival and to get home.\r\n\r\nTom Hank\'s acting is top-notch in this movie. It also features a kick-ass plane crash scene that started it all. Cast Away (2000) is an inspiring tale of perseverance that leaves us in admiration for the human spirit.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGuOZPwLayY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>3. Forrest <span class=\"wo fr-9\" data-num=\"9\">Gump</span> (1994)</strong></h2>\r\nThis movie has given us one of Hollywood’s most memorable characters. Tom Hanks, in the titular role, gave a performance of a lifetime. The movie is about the life of Forest (Tom Hanks) <span class=\"wo fr-10 replaced\" data-num=\"10\">—</span> a young man with a double-digit IQ but a heart of gold. Going through a series of true historical events in the United States, Forest’s only desire is to unite with the love of his life.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3450 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg\" alt=\"feel good movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nWith Hanks’ exceptional acting and an amazingly well-written story, this movie teaches you a lot about life as a journey and its meaning. It tells you that life can throw a lot at you, some of it may not be pleasant, but we shouldn’t let setbacks hold us back.\r\n\r\nThis movie also sends a message that you don’t have to be smart to be happy and even the actions of a simple man can affect the lives of people around him in a very positive way.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLvqoHBptjg[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>2. The <span class=\"wo fr-11\" data-num=\"11\">Shawshank</span><span class=\"wo fr-12\" data-num=\"12\">  </span>Redemption (1994)</strong></h2>\r\nWe return once again to our duo from The Green Mile (1999) — writer Stephen King and director Frank <span class=\"wo fr-13\" data-num=\"13\">Darabont</span>. This movie is perhaps the best and most memorable creation from the famous writer and director.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3451 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/9.jpg\" alt=\"feel good movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThe <span class=\"wo fr-14\" data-num=\"14\">Shawshank</span><span class=\"wo fr-15\" data-num=\"15\">  </span>Redemption (1994) takes a horrific environment and turns it into a <span class=\"wo fr-16\" data-num=\"16\">petri-dish</span> of humanity. This <span class=\"wo fr-17\" data-num=\"17\">petri-dish</span> comes in the form of a prison populated with some truly awful men as well as men who have done awful things but are becoming better humans.\r\n\r\nAfter the credits roll we are left feeling glad knowing that people and hope can survive even in the darkest of places.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmzuHjWmXOc[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>1. The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)</strong></h2>\r\nThis is a top movie from the list of Hollywood feel-good movies.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see a movie about what a perfect father should be, then you must watch The Pursuit of Happyness (2006). Based on the real-life story of Chris Gardner played by Will Smith, this movie depicts the struggle of a poor father trying to give his son a good life while attempting to switch to a life-changing professional career.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3452 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/10.jpg\" alt=\"The Pursuit of Happiness (2006)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThe director could not have picked a better cast than Will Smith and real-life his son <span class=\"wo fr-18\" data-num=\"18\">Jaden</span> Smith. This movie’s gritty realism will make you feel as if you’re watching a documentary on someone’s life.\r\n\r\nThe Pursuit of Happyness (2006) celebrates virtues like hard-work and integrity in a man. It doesn’t just show you the hardships of an impoverished single parent but also sends you a message that no matter how hard you are pushed by life, you can always get up.\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMOBlEcRuw8[/embedyt]\r\n\r\nSo this is our list of Hollywood\'s Top 10 Feel-Good Movies, hope you liked our content\r\n\r\n<b>– Abhishek Tewari</b>','Hollywood\'s Top 10 Feel-Good Movies You Must Watch','','publish','open','open','','hollywoods-top-10-feel-good-movies-you-must-watch','','','2021-01-08 11:05:19','2021-01-08 05:35:19','',0,'https://www.thetvfreak.com/?p=3414',0,'post','',0),(3421,9,'2020-12-19 16:29:50','2020-12-19 10:59:50','<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology is without a doubt a blessing, which has helped the human race reach new heights of progress. From the 18th Century, we have seen its rise in almost all aspects of society. For example, for cooling ourselves off on a hot day, we had electric fans. And For communicating with people from afar, we have mobile phones. For moving from place to place, we have now cars. And speaking of cars, today’s list will feature some of the well-known and great car racing movies that will help you remain entertained in the pandemic. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This car racing movies list will ensure you to move your seat to a distant place and away from all the problems, you can possibly have with the pandemic. So let’s dive in!</span>\r\n<h2><b>10.

I hope you were waiting for this Franchise to pop up anytime now! So this Franchise went from illegal street racing to becoming fugitives living abroad. Then finally took its turn as hunting down spies and cyber terrorists (that’s a real thing now!). The movie shows how so many Ludacris odds (no pun intended)  were stacked in the form of the FBI, the Cartel, the Shaw Family, and now a cyber-terrorist named Cipher.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of fast cars and family intertwined with one another, making it one of the biggest franchises in Hollywood, lasting for two decades now! So instead of one movie, I would suggest eight of them instead! </span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here is something you might never know about the title of the movie. The title happens to be known as ‘Redline’ at first for the very first movie. It implies the maximum speed a car can go. After a very tiring discussion from the cast members, they finally decided to come up with the title that promised in making billions in the box office</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Netflix, Prime Video</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uisBaTkQAEs[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>9.

The answer is that they just are. In a post-apocalyptic world, where people make monster-like cars and trucks into ships with grotesque Cirque du Soleil Acts on top (literally), we see how people tend to fight in tribes over scarce resources.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Australian Movie Brings us to a landscape as the entire world is on the brink of extinction, but civilization is emerged by a tyrannical ruler. One of the warriors of this ruler happens to take away the ruler’s wives and makes an escape for their lives.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along the way, she joins forces with one of the captives of the same ruler, Max Rockatansky. They make a run from the ruler in a heavily fortified truck called the War Rig, and battle with the ruler’s henchmen in a high-speed chase across the deserts.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Achievements/ Nominations:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academy Award - Best Production Design: Lisa Thompson, Colin Gibson (2016)</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MTV Award - Best Female Performance: Charlize Theron (2016)</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Critics’ Choice Award - Best Actor (Action Movie): Tom Hardy (2016)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  The Director of the movie, George Miller, also happens to have an M.D. Secondly, Max is not the main character of the film, although he has a major presence in the movie itself.

It talks about a successful construction worker who faces adversity in the next one and a half-hour or so. In the meantime, he makes his way from Birmingham to London, where his one-night stand comes into labour. This led to Ivan (Locke) losing his marriage and his job in the process.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he regrets his wrong and admits it on the phone (while en route to London for his affair), he tries to fix whatever he can on the phone and tries to confine the entire story inside his car.

The movie features F1 Racing legends James Hunt and Nikki Lauda.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie portrays their intense rivalry on the race track where Nikki Lauda often came out victorious. James at one point bested Nikki but that situation entirely changed over time. Hunt embarks on a journey to best Lauda once again, which tests his skill and undying spirit altogether.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nikki Lauda and James Hunt were actually great friends both on and off the track.

But as the order of the world is naturally concerned, some drivers have their ups and some of them have their downs.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story then takes a turn, as a former F1 driver from France, takes over the NASCAR Division and dethrones Ricky in the process. The movie hilariously shows his resurgence in the sport that he loves and how he takes back his throne from Jean (the French Driver!).</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amazing chemistry of the comedic duo of John C.

However, such a life got the best of him, forcing him into becoming an informant for the police.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The police intended in taking down an organization, responsible for stealing a lot of exotic cars and shipping them off to West Africa. In their own words, they wanted to become \'A car sales insurance’s worst nightmare’. Tensions only rose as things started to unfold in the story. And it now becomes more than a large car shipping operation.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Netflix, Amazon Prime.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYW8Qjhx3KM[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3.

He pays it off by being the getaway driver in many heist jobs.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He dodges all the police cars around effortlessly and manages to get away with it every time (at least that is true in the movie for now). However, when the deal is paid off, he finds that he is still needed for one last job, which leads him to further trouble with his boss. Time only tells whether he will be able to escape with his newly met affair. No doubt that it is also the best selection for the car racing action movies list.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Achievements/ Nominations:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BAFTA - Best Editing: Jonathan Amos (2018)</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NME Awards - Best Film (2018)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \'Baby\' in the movie is actually an autistic individual, which is discreetly implied by the number of iPods he has in his pockets and the fact that he can drive masterfully behind the wheel.

He is known to be one of the best precision and rally car drivers from Hollywood. The first 12 minutes only show what the character is made of and how he deals with the pressure around him as he masterfully sneaks around and discreetly escapes the cops, while he escorts a band of robbers with him. He later falls in love with a woman, Irene, who is also the wife of a criminal. The driver would then involve himself in the criminal\'s situation and the audience will only take note of how things get only worse from there.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the production phase of the film, Ryan was allowed to pick any car for his character development and instructed him to rebuild it.  He solely chose and rebuilt a 73’ Chevrolet Malibu.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Netflix, Vudu, Fandango, Google Play.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBiOF3y1W0Y[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>1.

I mean why not? This movie is one of the best racing movies that are also made for the kids as well here! The movie, as we all know, is based on a global racing game franchise since the 1990s, and it still is a global phenomenon to this day. This movie is the best selection for the list of movies for car enthusiasts.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, the story starts with a famous racing prodigy from Mount Cisco named Tobey Marshall. He was bested once from his long arch-rival Dino Brewster, in this race in which Dino took away everything from Tobey. Dino would set on to become a famous race car driver while Tobey stayed and worked in his Father’s garage. The two meet again, as Dino offers him to work on a new car. It was also at this point, his father died and Tobey was facing financial debt otherwise he was to lose his garage.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This only coerced him into accepting Dino’s offer but it also led Tobey in losing not only his garage but his freedom and one of his friends. He spent time behind bars and he devised to exact his revenge through a way they were both good at and that was behind the wheel.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Netflix.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3wtVI-aJuw[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Conclusion:</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a car enthusiast myself, I assure you that there are still more street racing movies from the world of cars.

I am sure you will get it from anywhere but the quality of stuff you will get from here can not be seen anywhere. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me tell you a bit about myself. I love basketball and if you are not much familiar with the culture of the NBA, then this is your chance. These basketball movies lists happen to be based on the <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/category/hollywood/\">best Hollywood movies</a> on sports. It is either used as a medium for teaching or even as a form of entertainment. You would be amazed to know that most of the fans have already watched them. Nonetheless, these are some of the movies I can find for you to enjoy. So let’s Dive in!</span>\r\n<h2><b>1. White Men can’t jump (1992) | Basketball movies</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>IMDb rating:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 6.8</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ron Shelton</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Starcast:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes, Rosie Perez</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this movie talks about a white baller named Billy Hoyle. He is known to bet on basketball games and makes his opponents always underestimate, simply because he is told to be white. But that doesn’t stop him from embarrassing them now and then.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4148 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basketball-movies-based-on-true-stories-4.jpg\" alt=\"White Men can’t jump (1992) basketball movies based on true stories (4)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of his opponents becomes his biggest allies on the court, named Sidney Dean, and together they stack up a lot of money from any competition they find on the court.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billy stacks up this money so that he could avoid the mobsters and pay them off. He also tries to keep his wife unaware of his situation while earning some money on the court.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When it comes to real life, Both Harrelson and Snipes were actually good at basketball. They were so good that both could have made it easier in the NCAA III Division. In fact, it was Harrelson who bested Snipes every time in real life as well.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fandango, Vudu, Amazon Prime.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHRvNAENaxk[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>2.

Jackson, Channing Tatum, Rick Gonzalez</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coach Carter is a great movie about a former coach (named Ken Carter), who decides to uptake the coaching of his former basketball team in Richmond High School.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4149 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basketball-movies-based-on-true-stories-5.jpg\" alt=\"Coach Carter (2005) basketball movies based on true stories (5)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After coming back to his own school, he realized that the task ahead wasn’t short. The fact that the condition of the school deteriorated due to the increase in the crimes and gang affiliations led to Richmond High a very unhealthy environment.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping this in mind, the coach decides to work through his students and promises them that they will not only become better players but also better human beings.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Achievements/ Nominations:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Movie Award - Outstanding Achievement in Directing: Thomas Carter (2006)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is one of the best basketball movies based on true stories that is on a Richmond High Basketball Coach Ken Carter, who is known to suspend his team due to their poor academic results.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Netflix.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_GleoanbPE[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3.

It features a man named Jackie Moon, who tries to put his team (the Flint Tropics, since he is from his Hometown in Michigan) on the NBA Map.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4182 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/750x6d00-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He tries to make sure that by the following year, his team can play and possibly win an NBA title. And to win his spot, Jackie decides to do a little more than just show up in his basketball games (as in the start-up line); he promotes his team through Bizzare and almost unheard-of ways.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One promotion or another, he gains the favour of the crowd and only time tells whether he makes it to the NBA or not. But be warned, things can get a little too much due to the strong language and nudity. So this is one of the best NBA Films to watch. </span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  In the movie, Jackie (Will Ferrel) mentions that he never vomited before at all. However, as his real-life goes, Will had a condition as a baby (‘pyloric stenosis’), which led him to incessantly puke all the time. He even has a scar on the upper right abdomen for him to prove it.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Vudu, Fandango, Prime Watch.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNGqlzoHrrI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4.

These aliens managed to steal the talent of various players and will use it to beat the Looney Tunes.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequence of not playing or even losing against the Nerdlucks will result in the slavery of the Looney Tunes in Moron Mountain.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  During the production phase of the movie, Jordan was retired for real from the sport he loved.

This is one of the most recent movies about basketball which brings us a streetball legend named Uncle Drew. He meets Dax, who happens to face a lot of financial problems.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4147 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basketball-movies-based-on-true-stories-3.jpg\" alt=\"Uncle Drew (2018) basketball movies based on true stories (3)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be specific, he has lost his lifelong savings, which he needed to enter the Rucker Classic streetball tournament in Harlem. Dax not only lost his life savings but also his former team to a lifelong rival.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dax now makes a whole new team, as he finds with Drew, his old teammates, and brings his team back together for the tournament.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The three mentioned star cast have all played for the Boston Celtics, one of the most prized teams (alongside the Los Angeles Lakers.)</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Netflix, Prime Video, Fandango, Vudu</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv1xscwDtIQ[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Conclusion:</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this is my list of movies in case you want to put your interests the way I do.

So the following list doesn’t happen to include trilogies. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That will be an article for another day. So let’s Dive in!</span>\r\n<h2><b>1. The Lord of the Rings + The Hobbit</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Peter Jackson</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Starcast:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3650 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Some-of-the-Best-Movie-Franchises-to-Binge-About-5.jpg\" alt=\"The Lord of the Rings + The Hobbit: Some of the Best Movie Franchises to Binge About (5)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this series of films take you back to Middle Earth, an adaptation of the writer of the novel, J. R. Tolkien. This epic Saga takes you to a world where evil is at large in the shape of Sauron. A world filled with Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Goblins, and Dragons (who can forget Dragons!), makes you forget the present.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This 18- hour long Saga can easily take your problems away for the day, especially if you are not sleeping well enough.

Every time it’s an impossible situation, but McClane’s will and wits always manage to outsmart everyone time and time again.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Despite its amazing story and amazing acting, this film Franchise hasn’t managed to win an Oscar since its Inception, which dates to 1988.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fandango, Vudu, Amazon Prime.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TQ-pOvI6Xo[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3.

As the title suggests, one comes across a huge alien lifeform that imposes danger to everyone in space. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The series has its own pioneered concept, which is why it is very popular up to this date. And if you take my word, then watch the very first scenes of the very first movie. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll be up for a big surprise! This is truly a series just for you because in space no one can hear you scream!</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  So we see a lot of spacesuits in the first movie. In fact, these suits gave the cast members a lot of trouble in the making of the movie. It got so hot wearing them at times that people from the cast started to faint often. But you might have heard:” Sacrifices have to be made.”</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Vudu, Fandango, Prime Watch.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svnAD0TApb8[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4.

And when he harbours that the enemy is actually within himself, he manages to get to the top.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This simple concept of man’s limitless potential and perseverance through adversity is what made the Rocky Series reach to the top, as to how it stands today.

The entire movie shows the beauty of space and all the stars and planets the crew comes across. The movie can definitely take its time in having you lost in outer space and question your own existence, as Nolan created an epic mystery.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZCsQfWPZPo[/embedyt]\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Achievements/ Nominations:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academy Award- Best Visual Effects: Paul J.

Prior to the making of the film, Dr. Thorne laid two rules for the director to abide by while making his film: the movie should abide by the laws of physics and any outrageous speculation should come from the mind of a scientist; not of the director or writer.

But now I am bringing my list of some of the best trilogies movies for you to watch now. This list will definitely assure you to watch some of the best movie trilogies in the movie history made with sequels and will give you the time you need to enjoy. So let’s dive in!</span>\r\n<h2><b>1. The Matrix Trilogy (1999-2003) | Best Trilogies</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Lana Wachowski, Lily Wachowski</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Starcast:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Ann Moss.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The series is a cyberpunk subgenre of Sci-Fi, based on the phenomena of Artificial Intelligence, a phenomenon that was predicted back two decades ago. This theme brings us to a computer programmer named Thomas Anderson, by the alias of Neo (who is also a hacker). He pursues the true meaning of his world and therefore, tries to unravel “The Matrix”.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3739 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Some-of-the-Best-Trilogies-worth-Watching-3.jpg\" alt=\"The Matrix Trilogy (1999-2003) \" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This pursuit led him to be recuperated from a state of physical inactivity, as Neo realizes that the world he lived in was digitized. In fact, what he came to realize was the downfall of human beings from Intelligent Machines, which managed to outsmart humankind and revolutionize themselves into an army. Neo is the key to bringing down the machines and tries to bring a war between the humans and the machines once and for all.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKQi3bBA1y8[/embedyt]\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So the man behind the chosen one’s rescue is Morpheus. But may I indulge with the origins of that word; well, from Greek Mythology, ‘Morpheus’ refers to the god of dreams.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Warner Bros.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>2. Back to the Future (1985-1990) | Best Trilogies</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Robert Zemeckis.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Starcast:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Christopher Lloyd, Michael J.Fox, Lea Thompson.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever thought of writing a right in place of a wrong by having a time machine? Well, this series is based on an adolescent named Marty who travels in a time machine, to do just that.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3740 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Some-of-the-Best-Trilogies-worth-Watching-4.jpg\" alt=\"Back to the Future (1985-1990)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marty had a tough life growing up and himself being bullied at school. He meets an eccentric friend named Emmett Brown, who was the mind behind his time machine, which was a car that ran on Plutonium. As he uses his car to transverse back into the past, he realized that his actions can inadvertently affect the future. The movie has many different twists with its story, along with a few gags. It is definitely a classic if you are into its nostalgia.</span>\r\n\r\nThis is one of the greatest movie trilogies that are based on science. Actually, we can say only interesting trilogy.\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMOgXa2PIuE[/embedyt]\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The scientist in the film planned to have a pet chimpanzee as his assistant and companion. However, due to the budget being short, the directors instead opted for a dog.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Netflix, Prime Video, Fandango.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>3. Lord of the Rings (2001-2003)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Peter Jackson</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Starcast:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this trilogy takes you back to Middle Earth, an adaptation of the writer of the novel, J.R.R. Tolkien. It brings you to a land of magic, harbored by Orcs, Elves, Wizards, Dragons, Dwarves, and Men (Mankind) into one place.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3741 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Some-of-the-Best-Trilogies-worth-Watching-5.jpg\" alt=\"Lord of the Rings (2001-2003) Some of the Best Trilogies worth Watching (5)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It talks about a constant struggle between good and evil, with the antagonists having the upper hand, under the command of Sauron. But an epic battle between both forces lead to evil dormant but for only a matter of time.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A companionship of Hobbits, Humans, an elf, and a Dwarf aims to bring down Sauron once and for all, as his soul is trapped in a ring which can only be destroyed from the flames it was shaped into. This trilogy immerses us in a saga of their adventure as this group embarks on a journey to evil to its demise once and for all.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKEGZ-CvWHk[/embedyt]\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Warner Bros, Vudu, Fandango, Prime Watch.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>4. The Dark Knight (2005-2012)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Christopher Nolan</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Starcast:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe don\'t really think that you didn\'t watch it. Almost every movie person knows that this is the best movie trilogies all the time to watch.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3737 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Some-of-the-Best-Trilogies-worth-Watching-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Dark Knight (2005-2012) Some of the Best Trilogies worth Watching (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The DC Universe decided to reboot the making of Batman in a more sober yet epic fashion, back in the early 2000s. In the city of Gotham, where crime being at an alarmingly high rate is considered normal. The city is also a birthplace for many superheroes among whom, is none other than the Dark Knight. This trilogy shows how the Knight came to be, his struggles against his biggest foes like the Joker, Bane, and Scarecrow.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXeTwQWrcwY[/embedyt]\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  This is known to be the only Batman trilogy completed by a single director. In the beginning of every movie, the henchmen are dressed in the shape of the main villain.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> WarnerBros, Vudu, Fandango, Prime Watch</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>5. The Godfather (1972-1990)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Director:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Francis F. Cappola.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Starcast:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trilogy of this mob drama is derived from the novel of Mario Puzo, having the same name. It focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family in New York named the Coerleones.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3743 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Some-of-the-Best-Trilogies-worth-Watching-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"Some of the Best Trilogies worth Watching (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were a powerful family by the 1940s (according to Puzo\'S Adaptation). When the don\'s youngest son, Michael (also a Marine from World War II), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in a series of events leading to fights and betrayal. This trilogy provides a saga revolving around Michael. It\'s very first instalment is the main reason why this series was even a trilogy in the first place!</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY1S34973zA[/embedyt]\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Fun Fact: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initial instalment of the trilogy was the highest-grossing film of 1972, and back then the highest-grossing film ever made.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Platforms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Prime Watch</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>Conclusion:</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this is my list of trilogies worth the watch.

Today, we are counting down our picks for Top 10 Hollywood Villains. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our list will include the best superhero villains as well as ordinary people committing some extraordinarily villainous acts. However, we will not be including any animated characters on this list. Let’s begin.</span>\r\n<h2><b>10. Amy, Gone Girl (2014) | Hollywood Villains</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3711 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Villains-1.jpg\" alt=\"Amy, Gone Girl (2014) \" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We begin our list with Amy (Rosamund Pike) who fills in the shoes of a traditional female villain archetype. Gone Girl (2014) begins as a mystery movie revolving around Amy’s sudden disappearance with her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) as the primary suspect. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As is the case with many other mystery <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/category/hollywood/\">Hollywood movies</a>, you begin to piece together evidence to form an explanation. But no sooner than you manage to make sense out of it all, the movie takes a dark and twisted turn.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gone Girl (2014) has given Rosamund Pike a once in a lifetime role. This movie sends a message that when a couple leaves each other but somehow can\'t make it work, that might turn into a real tragedy.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym3LB0lOJ0o[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>9. The Armitage Girl, Get Out (2017)</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3712 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Villains-2.jpg\" alt=\"The Armitage Girl, Get Out (2017) \" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine meeting the love of your life, a girl who is just perfect in all ways possible. As time passes by, this girl takes you to her parents\' house to meet them. Once in the house, the next thing you realize is that her family is trying to sell your body in an auction.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Armitage girl comes from a family that is heavily racist. A family that takes manipulation to an incredible height. A family that can only be described as evil. What makes this family stand apart is that on the outside they\'re just your regular next-door family. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They maintain an outward appearance of being open-minded, progressive like any other urban family. But behind closed doors, they indulge in humanity\'s most gruesome and selfish desires.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9su2d0WM2I[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>8. Killmonger, Black Panther (2018) |</b><b> Hollywood Villains</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3713 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Villains-3.jpg\" alt=\"Killmonger, Black Panther (2018) Top 10 Hollywood Villains (3)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/the-chronological-order-of-the-marvel-cinematic-universe/\">Marvel Comic Universe</a> has brought us some impressive villains. With Erik “Killmonger” Stevens, they really nailed it! Black Panther (2018) is the first comic book superhero film nominated for the Best Picture at the Oscars.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a number of reasons contributed to this nomination it’s not hard to see that Killmonger was an essential one.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Played remarkably by Michael B Jordan, Killmonger is a full-fledged villain. For all his lethal methods, he has sympathetic and relatable motivations.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An emotionally deep character having a solid backstory. Combining that with his personality...you\'ve got an outstanding villain matching our superhero in all respect.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>7. Terrence Fletcher, Whiplash (2014)</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3714 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Villains-4.jpg\" alt=\"Terrence Fletcher, Whiplash (2014)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The villains discussed so far have been notorious characters for the most part. But our next villain is just a music teacher/ conductor with no murderous intention. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\'s exactly this trait that makes him a villain like any other.  The kind of antagonist anyone could come across in their regular academic/ professional careers.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">J.K. Simmons won an Academy Award for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role for playing Terrence Fletcher. He is an emotional manipulator who preys on the vulnerability as well as the ambitions of his students.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this just for his hunt for musical perfection. He\'s cruel. He\'s violent. But he\'s fundamentally human with a certain amount of sentiment and honour. But just like many other villains, he doesn’t consider himself as one.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d_jQycdQGo[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>6. Joker, The Joker (2019) </b><b>| Hollywood Villains</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Joker is one of the best Hollywood villains in movie history. In The Joker (2019), this character has demonstrated that he doesn\'t need Batman to maintain that fame.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3715 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Villains-5.jpg\" alt=\"Joker, The Joker (2019)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental illness is a difficult subject to address. There’s always an apprehension of demonizing it especially in a situation when the character featured is a villain. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The moviemaker did a fantastic job of turning this character into someone who can be both sympathetic and someone who lives up to his villainous legacy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Arthur Fleck puts on his Joker persona and allows his dark side to take over, he becomes an agent of chaos.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>5. Calvin Candie, Django Unchained (2019)</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leonardo DiCaprio is among the most talented actors of our generation. Can you imagine anyone else playing the role of Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) so well? He made Belfort both reprehensible and so magnetically charming at the same time.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3716 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Villains-6.jpg\" alt=\"Calvin Candie, Django Unchained (2019)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But he\'s just as skilful in turning off that charm. His portrayal of a 19th-century vicious slave owner called Calvin Candie in Django Unchained (2019) is a testament to that. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio truly commits to this sadistic, spiteful, and entirely repulsive villain. His racism has no limit nor does his bigotry. But the swagger, finesse, and quirks with which DiCaprio portrayed this character made him one of the most loved Hollywood villains.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that he didn\'t get a nomination in the Academy Awards despite this stellar performance is unbelievable.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iH0UBYDI4g[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4. Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter Series.</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had established himself as one of the most famous Hollywood villains in the fantasy genre long before he appeared on the big screen. That\'s right! We are talking about Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter Series.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3717 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Villains-7.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter Series\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was quite a challenge to meet the expectations of the fans while making a motion picture interpretation of the book. But the moviemakers did a splendid job especially Ralph Fiennes at playing Lord Voldemort. In fact, for many fans, it was as if the Dark Lord had appeared right from the page to the screen.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ralph Fiennes holds nothing back, fully capturing the character especially in the final part of this franchise, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011). He is imposing, cruel, and cunning. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is terror in every word he utters. Yet he has a charisma that makes you understand how he seduces characters to take his side.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EC2tmFVNNE[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3. Pennywise, It Series</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our next villain is a horrifying cosmic being in the form of a sinister clown.  Pennywise — the Dancing Clown. He knows how to appeal to the good-natured and sympathy of kids. And he knows how to devour them after he has seasoned their meat using fear.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3718 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Villains-8.jpg\" alt=\"Pennywise, It Series \" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bill Skarsgard has given a lifetime performance. He has made an entire generation of movie fans terrified of this evil villain. The horror genre is full of terrifying monsters but with his uniquely evil persona and the pleasure he obtains in his work, Pennywise stands apart.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>2.

Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), however, is a worthy successor to Vader.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He’s compelled by his emotions of negative as well as positive kind. He resembles Vader\'s internal conflict between the dark and bright sides of the force personified.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a lot of ways, he is a tortured and complicated character that the movie-maker was trying to portray with Anakin Skywalker in the earlier films. Adam Driver gave a powerful performance played with nuance taking the franchise to a new height.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOC8E8z_ifw[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>1.

He is, for all intents and purposes, a brute and formidable physical threat but it is his unflinching resolve that makes up for his greatest strength. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This complex yet charismatic character raised the bar for the future generation of villains.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanos has something in common with the best Hollywood villains in movie history. He believes that his extreme and catastrophic methods are completely justifiable and reasonable from a utilitarian viewpoint.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Culminating 21 Marvel movies into Endgame (2019), Thanos shook the Universe to its crux. An antagonist the likes of which we have never seen. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A super-villain whose reputation is elevated even more by the sheer magnitude of the cinematic event in which he makes an appearance.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xBziiJI3DU[/embedyt]','Top 10 Hollywood Villains Who Won Millions of Heart','','publish','open','open','','top-10-hollywood-villains-who-won-millions-of-heart','','','2020-12-26 22:25:58','2020-12-26 16:55:58','',0,'https://www.thetvfreak.com/?p=3692',0,'post','',0),(3896,9,'2020-12-30 22:45:49','2020-12-30 17:15:49','<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the current year coming to a close, one certain thing is that there weren’t a lot of Hollywood movies 2020 we heard of being released. In fact, I would beg to differ for a few best movies of Hollywood in 2020 that definitely made their mark this year.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we have only a few days left in this year, today’s list should definitely finish your year a little better. For today’s list, I will bring a bit of a countdown sequence for these 10 Hollywood movies, to keep things interesting. So let’s dive in!  </span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>10. </b><b>Project Power</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>IMDb rating:</strong> 6</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Director:</strong> Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Starcast:</strong> Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Dominique Fishback</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting with one of my personal favourites (despite the low IMDB Ratings), this movie is a great combination of mystery and Sci-Fi. Ask yourself this one thing: Why would you have people selling drugs in those Cops movies unless you can let them sell power?</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3900 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-2.jpg\" alt=\"Project Power\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second Question: What’s your Favourite Animal? What’s your Power? All these questions bring out a unique plot to the film and a great sense of nostalgia and adventure.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie will assure you to have your attention undivided throughout. It revolves around a former US ranger who teams up with a cop to stop a bunch of powerful influences to stop giving away their pills which gives ordinary people superpowers. Give it a watch! I won’t fail you!  </span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Fun Fact: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the movie, one of the cast members, Rodrigo Santoro (the mastermind behind the pills), takes one for himself and becomes a grotesque giant with super strength. The fact that his transformation is not CGI-based but itself a nine-hour transformation process is itself astonishing.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Platforms:</strong> Netflix.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw1vQgVaYNQ[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>9. </b><b>The Nest </b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>IMDb rating:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 6.3</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Director:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  Sean Durkin</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Starcast:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  Jude Law, Carrie Coon, Oona Roche.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nest is a great Drama and <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-movies-about-billionaires-falling-in-love/\">Romance movie</a> featuring an entrepreneur, whose life takes a tumble into a twisted turn of events when his family altogether agree to move into an English Manor in Surrey.

The movie starts with a Mexican drug Lord’s son and wife, who embark on a quest to rid of those who were involved in his father\'s imprisonment. That includes none other than Detective Mike Lowry as well. Realizing that he cannot stop what\'s coming to him, he decides to take some help from his old friend and partner Marcus.

This was due to his personal reasons which weren\'t known by then (they unfold through the plot of the movie). He finds himself then in a meaningless job, suffering from alcoholism. As the title suggests, he makes his comeback and fights back against everything he was held down with, both his personal issues and that of his team.   </span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Platforms:</strong> Fandango, Vudu, Prime Watch.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzNJVSsjE-I[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>5. </b><b>Extraction</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>IMDb rating:</strong> 6.7</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Director:</strong> Sam Hargrave</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Starcast: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/best-movies-of-chris-hemsworth-except-mcu/\">Chris Hemsworth</a>, David Harbour, Randeep Hooda</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extraction is one of the best indie-films on the Netflix platform, bringing us a unique and diverse cast with compelling action stories.

So, now you get it that Hollywood movies list 2020 can not be completed without this amazing action movie.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Fun Fact: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Russo Brothers are especially known to be among the producers of the recent Avengers: Endgame.

It brings us to a small town where a young man named Arvin. At one point in his life, he realizes he realizes how sinful and corrupted their town has become. A preacher living a life of sins, a selfish policeman who is devoted to his own self of justice, a cameraman who hides and takes photos of people’s flaws.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3906 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-8.jpg\" alt=\"The Devil All the Time Top 10 Hollywood Movies of 2020 (8)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie is themed under the phrase, ”Some people were born so that they could be buried”. It reflects on how people have this influence to sin time and time again while they live on and get buried with their sins. This movie gives the impression of a horror film, but the irony is that it portrays in its revering way of the human soul.    </span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Fun Fact: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The venue of the movie is actually a real town. It’s the name of the town where the author of the novel was born in. Its history lives up to the atmosphere of the movie. According to one theory, the name “Knockemstiff” came from two women who argued over a man they both liked. The preacher of that town was involved to settle the dispute whose judgment was short and to the point: ”Knock him Stiff”.   </span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Platforms:</strong> Netflix</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIzazUv2gtI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3. </b><b>Tenet</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>IMDb rating:</strong> 7.6</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Director:</strong> Christopher Nolan.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Starcast: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> John David Washington, Robert Patterson, Elizabeth Debicki</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let me put it out there just before I start: It’s a Chris Nolan film so you know it’ll be an epic piece of art for your home theatre.

At one point, people will be shooting bullets but at another stage, there’ll be bullets being caught by guns (in reverse). Its unique concept definitely receives a lot of praise. </span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Fun Fact: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie pays tribute to the former masterpiece of Nolan’s Inception. The manipulation of the timeline pays tribute to the former movie’s concept, as confirmed by John David Washington himself. However, both films aren’t claimed to be sequels of one another.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Platforms:</strong> Netflix, Fandango, Vudu, Prime Watch.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>2. </b><b>Another Round</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>IMDb rating:</strong> 8</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Director:</strong> Thomas Vinterberg.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Starcast: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Mad Mikkelsen, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-3908 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-10.jpg\" alt=\"Another Round Top 10 Hollywood Movies of 2020 (10)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This European movie is another highly praised film of 2020. It talks about four Swedish people, who read this research paper related to alcoholism. It discusses whether people with an alcohol content of 0.5% in their bloodstream lie a happier personal and professional life. Just to make things interesting, they put that theory to the test.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is a comedic drama, which brings chaos and drunk comedy to the test.

Th<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e past couple of years came to a realization that superhero movies were a trend worldwide (even to this day). You got Marvel and DC Comics running head to head with one another. There was even the rise of a third franchise named Variant Comics, courtesy of ‘BloodShot (2020)’. So it also came out obvious that Marvel Comics have the upper hand in this situation because of the variety of emotions they portray throughout their <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">movies</a> via their superheroes and <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-hollywood-villains-who-won-millions-of-heart/\">supervillains</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4055 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg\" alt=\"Wonder Woman\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DC happens to have a better quality of superheroes but the thing that lacked the most (as people say for themselves) is that they lacked the emotions expressed through their characters. In fact, nearly all of the DC movies have this aspect lacking.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all hope is lost, for in fact one of the movies did manage to survive the critics and what they have to say. This brings me to Zack Snyder’s ‘Wonder Woman’ which has surpassed many expectations and many doubts before it’s release. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article will highlight the reasons why the movie happens to stand out from all other DC Movies. It can possibly bring a comeback in the rise of DC movies as well. In fact, this also set expectations for its upcoming sequel by tomorrow. So let’s Dive In!</span>\r\n<h2>Wonder Woman Watch Trailer:</h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW2E2Fnh52w[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>The Prequel:</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, let’s talk about the concept. Well, it resembles Marvel\'s Captain America (the initial sequel). But it also shows her character more explicitly as compared to its counterpart. When Zeld is laid under siege, she successfully crosses No Man’s Land (an area well secured by the Germans). </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She intends to save the people held hostage and becomes more selfless, even though war does not leave many behind alive. Her selfless character led the Allied Forces to take over the crossing and defeat the enemy.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4056 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, let’s talk about the main character herself. Diana herself is a very overpowering Amazonian. But the fact that her character is flawed and is subjected to development, makes her very balanced in the movie. Not only that, time and time again she is aided by her companions at times of need, even by her affair, Steve Trevor.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she has an amazing feat of strength and speed, she finds herself confused in wearing human clothing. At times where she lacks human intelligence, her companions are always there to provide her with wisdom. In a universe filled with many flawed superheroes, she is without a shadow of a doubt one of a kind. Especially as a female protagonist, she is definitely unique to the DC Universe, courtesy of Synder’s directions for the movie plot.</span>\r\n<h2><b>More aspects to note of the Prequel:</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among all of the DC movies made by far, another great aspect about the movie was its mixture of emotions. At some parts of the movie, it was filled with great action sequences, along with gentle and uncanny humor over time. It managed simply debunks the myth to never bring a knife to a gunfight. It also harmonizes with the essence of thrilling adventure and rejuvenating romance. Another thing that makes sense is again her aid from her companions.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4057 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally (and most importantly), how many female superheroes are treated as a main character and protagonist, compared to all other superhero movies? This is an astonishing idea itself when you think about it. In fact, most of the superhero movies have mostly male protagonists with female actors as among the supporting characters or even villains.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wonder Woman is definitely a unique movie in this aspect, where she deserves the respect that she needs from an overpowering yet stunning superhero. The movie is definitely an indication for all superhero universes that the time for uplifting female superheroes has now begun.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all those who love to watch this movie, you should definitely find it on the Warner Bros. or even the HBO Max Platform.  </span>\r\n<h2><b>The Sequel:</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With its sequel coming by tomorrow, a lot of expectations have accumulated whether the second movie will be any better than the first one. Wonder Woman 1984 will bring a whole situation for both Diana and Trevor. With human technology at new heights, time will definitely tell what is the situation from the plot. So here are some of the expectations I will briefly go through for the upcoming sequel.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4058 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, let’s talk about the obvious; character development. First of all, we saw Diana hasn’t aged a bit at all. Given the situation around her, she has become more mature than ever. However, with the return of Steve Trevor, she now has the roles reversed with him in terms of being the role model and the guide for Steve.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a hero, she has become more skilled than ever. She literally can swing around lightning, just like Spiderman (only making Spiderman ironically new to that web-swinging concept). In one of the fight scenes, her armor is literally gold. Clearly, she came around some relic or realization that she has more power when confronting her villainous counterpart. Secondly (and speaking of counterparts), we came around a new villain, known to be “Cheetah” (also named Barbara Ann) from the comics.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheetah has a great history as being one of Wonder Woman’s nemesis from DC Comics. But from the trailers, we also see that the actual mastermind behind the whole plot might be Maxwell Lord. So tomorrow’s release of the sequel will definitely unfold his plans.      </span>\r\n<h2><b>My Verdict:</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what I expect about the movie is something really above my expectations. Provided all that is needed to know, I think that Wonder Woman 84 is worth the watch. With a female superhero-supervillain clash by the movie directors as a unique concept for this sequel, I think this film is a must-watch. The concept happens to also complement well with the clues we have been provided. This should definitely be something worth the watch.</span>','Wonder Woman - DC’s Shining Ray of Hope | Review','','publish','open','open','','wonder-woman-dcs-shining-ray-of-hope-review','','\nhttps://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-hollywood-villains-who-won-millions-of-heart/','2021-01-24 09:20:42','2021-01-24 03:50:42','',0,'https://www.thetvfreak.com/?p=3919',0,'post','',0),(4061,1,'2020-12-28 16:47:49','2020-12-28 11:17:49','<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coolie no 1 remake, one of the most anticipated and awaited films of Varun Dhawan and Sara Ali Khan was released yesterday on the eve of Christmas, December 25, 2020.

And it seems like everybody has a secret to hide.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is special about this movie is how geographical features are portrayed in it. The muddy, dusty, and greyish environment represented the mood of the movie very gracefully. This is one of the best Hollywood movies based on this content.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fpk3Lnc638[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>9.

Patty Jenkins is well-known for making movies about strong female leads and Monster is without any question her best creation. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A prostitute begins to kill her clients and eventually becomes a serial killer. In the movie ‘Monster’ you will get to see the world from a killer’s point of view.

He grew up in an orphanage without ever feeling loved. He is also gifted with an almost inhuman sense of smell (I am talking about how Hannibal could diagnose disease out of people by just smelling them, that level of smelling power). </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jean later uses his ability to make the most perfect perfume the world has ever known. But the persuasion will make him commit the ultimate crime.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They say a criminal is born that way or later made into one. You watch the movie and decide for yourself.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This movie also has a spin-off series Perfume(2018), IMDb rating of 7.1 (6,960 votes).

Memories of Murder (2003) | Serial Killers Movies</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>IMDb Rating: 8.1 (136,472 votes, #176 in the top 250 movie list)</li>\r\n <li>Director: Bong Joon-Ho (Also directed Parasite, Snowpiercer)</li>\r\n <li>Star Cast: Song Kang-Ho, Kim Sang-Kyung</li>\r\n <li>Platform: Amazon Prime Video, VUDU</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4094 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/movies-featuring-Serial-Killers-6.jpg\" alt=\" Memories of Murders (2003): movies featuring Serial Killers (6)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This movie is based on the first known serial killer of South Korea. An anonymous man rapes and then kills his victims on rainy nights. A young detective from the capital is sent to the crime area to catch the killer. In this movie, you will notice how characters can go through significant changes due to the impact of situations.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">People came to know about Bong Joon Ho only after his immense success with Parasite. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But before Parasite, there was ‘Memories of Murders’. </span></i>\r\n\r\n<b>Fun Facts:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is the second feature film directed by Bong Joon-ho.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n_HQwQU8ls[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4.

In the late 1960s, a new serial killer appeared in the history of America.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now the name may suggest that this killer chose his victims based on their Zodiac signs but that’s not the case. Like BTK killer and Son of Sam, the Zodiac killer liked to communicate via newspaper media, and he used to post advertisements that were written in the Zodiac sign. That’s how he got his name.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here Jake Gyllenhaal acted as a newspaper cartoonist who became obsessed with the Zodiac Killer case and went into a total detective mode. Robert Downey in the role of ‘Paul Avery’ played a sarcastic comic relief character which was really needed in a serious movie like this.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNncHPl1UXg[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3.

It seems like he has a thing for serial killers and psychopaths.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do you know about the seven deadly sins stated in the Holy Bible? They are Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, and Wrath. Ever thought a serial killer would use these sins as the pattern of his killing? Well, that’s what our killer did in the movie Se7en.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The movie is full of twists. The inside jokes and sarcasm of the characters: Somerset and Mills are very enjoyable. This is the Best Serial Killers Movies on Netflix along with the others from this list.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Se7en was nominated in Oscar for only one category: Best Film Editing.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Fun facts: </b>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The role ‘Mills’ was offered to Denzel Washington before Brad Pitt. Denzel rejected the role because he thought it was too dark.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znmZoVkCjpI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>2.

Psycho is the only black and white movie on this list but that does not lessen its significance even a bit.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A real estate secretary who has stolen money from her client, a creepy hotel in the middle of nowhere, and a psychopath run loose. The twists and suspense of this movie will drive you wild.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">‘Psycho’ was nominated for 4 Oscars but unfortunately did not win any.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Fun Facts:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is unknown to many but the movie ‘Psycho’ has 3 sequels, a remake, and a spin-off series: Bates Motel(2013-17, IMDb Rating: 8.1).

History of swear words trailer starting off with Nicholas Cage, screaming the F word out of the top of his lungs, he references his movie ‘DeadFall’.</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">He clearly shows that he will be the host of the six-episode-long documentary series and will work his way into the popular swear words derived out of political influences, theatre, and even music. He might also bring some of the best tv series as to referring to his act from the series.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4131 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/750x600-1.jpg\" alt=\"Nicholas Cage insult\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nicholas Cage continues to highlight the influence of this vice through all aspects of life. This clearly shows that swear words weren’t merely a part of our speech, as to condemn an opinion about things but they also show how these were significant factors in bringing zeal and enthusiasm in the minds of the recipients.</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Swear words at one point in history became so inadequately relevant at a particular place and at a particular time. It was how people finally </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">agreed to condemn them and call them ‘swear words’. So all of this will be elaborated on in the upcoming days.  </span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2mo8MSJRno[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Historical References:</span></strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, the history of swear words tv-series refers to all the swear words and provides us with an insight through time.

Alongside experts, are historians and entertainers, who will also share their opinions, while shedding light on the use of these words from around the world.</span>\r\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">“So why do people still use it?”:</span></strong></h3>\r\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Finally, the mini-series will also shed light on the future, as to why people still choose the habit to use such words in their day-to-day activity. Juxtaposing to this opinion, what were the efforts to make swear words infamous enough to be used in daily human communication.</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One example of this was “Explicit Content” and “Parental Advisory” stickers on the back labels of CDs. This might show how such content can avoid in. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5284 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/A-History-of-Swear-Words-Hold-that-Tongue-3.jpg\" alt=\"A History of Swear Words - Hold that Tongue\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To make things interesting, a series of short tests will possibly be featured in the segments, involving the use of these words.</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Possibly, the series will later imply human psychology and communication to keep the relevance of the series itself.

For me, I would likely rate all the 5 Best Movies that had been compiled an 8 out of 10! Why? Because their story timeline is really good and even if it is a classic or ‘old’ film you would say, it is still as fine as a romantic love story of all times. (I’m sorry but I love the romance genre, who doesn\'t!) Oh yes, please don’t forget to watch 5 of these movies, you can binge eating while watching this or watch it with your partner!

So more new TV shows for everyone to continue to binge on. In fact, some of you might jump on the Binge Bandwagon for Youtube TV just released the third season of the exhilarating “Cobra Kai”. Cobra Kai Season 3 release date 2020 is January starting.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4154 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cobra-kai-season-3-release-date-2.jpg\" alt=\"cobra kai season 3 release date (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So the following article will definitely convince you to jump on the bandwagon. I will be particular as to why you should definitely watch this season, and then we will also highlight some points for the next season as to what to expect from </span>cobra kai season 3 episode 1<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\nCheck out the best:\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcDQqGJG8pA[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Why Cobra Kai?</b></h2>\r\n<h3><b>A Tribute to a great movie franchise</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So starting off from the reason to watch this amazing season is its homage to one of the most popular movies of the 80s, The Karate Kid series. The trilogy itself is great, simply because of the love of Karate.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4153 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cobra-kai-season-3-release-date-1.jpg\" alt=\"cobra kai season 3 release date (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s first part simply shows how to stand up against people and how violence should only be resorted to as self-defence. At this point, everyone who is bullied at school will reflect on this and it simply gives them a sense of retribution at home.</span>\r\n<h3><b>A whole new Perspective</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Cobra Kai not only talks about self-defence but also talks about rising through adversity. The climax of the movie (the first part...) leads to a karate tournament, wherein the finals, the aggressor, Johnny Lawerence faces off against his victim, Daniel LaRusso. LaRusso upsets his aggressor’s expectations and finds himself the victor of the tournament. He manages to move and become a car dealer as witnessed from the First Season of Cobra Kai. However, the season centres around the aggressor who becomes oppressed and mourns off his life miserably, one beer at a time.</span>\r\n<h3>Johnny &amp; Daniel vs John Kreese Final Fight</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01F1T-qNXfQ[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>A Promising Sequel itself</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another fact which you might have guessed by now is the concept of moving along with the story. The fact that the seasons of Cobra Kai act entirely as a sequel to the movies is a unique concept. You are to witness the characters of the movie all grown up and now have kids of their own.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4152 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cobra-kai-season-3-release-date-3.jpg\" alt=\"cobra kai season 3 release date (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ironically, the kids are at each other’s throats and the audience of the digital generation has something of their own to live with. One validating aspect of this point is the footage of the movie fitting in between the storyline of Cobra Kai. That ensures the young audience with a comprehensive story. This without a shadow of doubt brings past references very clearly and to the point. At the same time provides a great show for the fans of the movie as well.   </span>\r\n<h2><b>So what’s next for Cobra Kai?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the </span>Cobra Kai season 3 release date Netflix<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was formerly announced for January 7th. But provided the eagerness of the fans, the directors decided not to make them wait for long. They then decided to release the third season on January the 1st. So here’s what we will expect from Cobra Kai Season 3 cast</span>.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So starting off with the trailer of the season itself, we see that Johnny, after establishing a great karate dojo for the Valley, finds one of his best students (Miguel) in the hospital after suffering from an expected broken back from his famously “infamous school fight”.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wZP_6qz8A[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All Johnny wanted for the students to become better people who can stand up for themselves and be the exact opposite of himself (and what he suffered in life). As for the fight himself, this leads us to the characters in their distressing states. Fed up and disheartened, he hands over his dojo to his former master, Sensei Creese (which was his intention to take over in the first place). </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel tries to talk sense into Johnny that both there are because of them and it is now a matter of time to make things right. He believes that the bad blood between them shouldn’t pass on to their kids. He also believes that despite starting this bad blood, they can still manage to work together and past their differences (provided the movie brings them their history). This season will most likely show the undoing of their rivalry. Asides from his rivalry with Johnny, we are to expect more familiar faces from the movie. But I think people should see for themselves why they were there, in the first place.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01F1T-qNXfQ[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawk tries to punish himself for being not enough in the school fight. He blames himself for not subduing people from the fight. He thinks of himself and his dojo fellows in a great sense of loss. In the trailer, we find him beating up a punching bag from the gym and struggling to move on from his losses (including his girlfriend, Moon. He has a tattoo on his chest reflecting on her name, which is now all covered up.)</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robby (Johnny\'s son, who is also one of LaRusso’s students) finds himself in a children\'s correctional facility. He finds himself doing time for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tory after heartbroken by Miguel’s affiliation with a drunk and confused Sam (of which Tory does not know of at all), makes her escape from school life. From the trailer, she seems to work at an underground level of the Valley, probably fighting for money. She also meets up with Sam at one point where it seems she will fulfil her revenge against her.    </span>\r\n<h3><strong>Have a look at the Cobra Kai season 3 trailer below:</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcDQqGJG8pA[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>My Verdict:</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So finally concluding this article with my verdict, I think the third season will unfold more about the movie franchise. Furthermore, we will definitely come about familiar faces from both the season as well as the franchise itself. Also, you will get the quick information for cobra kai season 4 as soon as possible. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time will tell how these new faces will support the never-ending problems between Miyagi-Do and Cobra Kai. If you still don’t believe me, check the IMDB ratings of this season yourself. This Cobra Kai Cast will not fail me!. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happy Binging!

All these years, Hollywood has gifted us with some of the iconic actors, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-rated-movies-you-should-watch/\">fascinating movies</a>, best music, and whatnot. Hence, to honour the special place it holds in our hearts, here tvfreak.com presents to you some of the amazing and interesting facts about its past, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/category/celebrities/\">celebrities</a>, movies, Hollywood facts etc. which are surely going to bewilder you.</span>\r\n<h2><b>1. The Father of Hollywood | Hollywood facts</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4203 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazing-best-funny-Hollywood-facts-3.jpg\" alt=\"The Father of Hollywood amazing, best, funny Hollywood facts (3)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">H.J. Whitley (1847-1931), considered the ‘Father of Hollywood’. But he had no connections with the world of cinema or any other forms of entertainment and was in fact a real estate developer. It was he who coined the term ‘Hollywood’. According to Whitley’s diary, in the year 1886 when he visited the town of ‘now called’ Hollywood along with his wife. It was a Chinese man who on being asked what he was doing in the hills, replied ‘I Hollywood’, which means ‘hauling wood’. It is this surprising reply that Whitley decide to name the town ‘Hollywood’.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLdDLeFbVow[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>2. The Story Behind the ‘HOLLYWOOD’ Sign | Hollywood facts</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most remarkable landmark of Hollywood, the hillside ‘Hollywood’ sign, which attracts tourists from all over the world was embedded in the year 1923 and was original ‘HOLLYWOODLAND’. Also, as a matter of fact, the sign wasn’t to denote the entertaining world of Hollywood at that time. It was only for advertising the new housing development in the hills above the Hollywood district. It was then in the year 1949 the ‘LAND’ was removed and the sign became, as we see now, ‘HOLLYWOOD’.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVng9mObaG4[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3. The Hollywood Walk of Fame</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the famous tourist attractions in the district of Hollywood is the Hollywood Walk of Fame consisting of around 2690 brass stars implanted in the pavement, featuring names of celebrities. It is including all ranging from producers, actors, musicians, characters, directors, and so on).</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, something that may sound amazing to you is here for you. It is the fact that an amount of $50,000 (as of 202) has to be submitted as a sponsorship fee during submission of the nomination application, for making of the star as well as, as a donation to the Hollywood Historic Trust for its maintenance. Of course, the celebrity himself doesn’t pay the amount. It is usually sponsored by the nominating organization, i.e., a fan club, a film studio, or any other associated sponsor.</span>\r\n<h2><b>4. Celebrity with the largest number of stars in the Walk of Fame</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Of course, having your name featured in only one star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame is not the limit. In fact, many of the celebrities like Tony Martin, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra have their names written in 3 or 4 stars but the renowned artist of all time, Gene Austry is the one to have his name in the highest number of five stars.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EELDW-b_K4A[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>5. In Old California | Hollywood facts</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first-ever Hollywood film, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Old California</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, released in 1910 was shot in just two days and has a running time of only 17 minutes.</span>\r\n<h2><b>6. Yoda’s physical appearance is the whose animated version?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the epic space opera of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Star Wars, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of our favourite characters, Yoda has a very uncanny resemblance with a world-famous personality. Can you guess who? Yes, right...with none other than the greatest theoretical physicist of all time, Albert Einstein. The reason behind this is more surprising.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv7J8rvIHok[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Star Wars’ </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">special effect artist, Stuart Freeborn wanted to give Yoda a wise look as per the character and was inspired by a photo of Albert Einstein, one of the most recognizable wise faces in the world. If you are feeling confused even now, take a closer look at Yoda\'s picture. Here, you will find, even if not the entire face, how much its wrinkles and eyes are similar to that of Einstein!</span>\r\n<h2><b>7. The fearsome dinosaur sounds from Jurassic Park | Hollywood facts</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, dinosaurs didn’t exist during the making of the movie </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jurassic Park</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which released in 1994. So, what about the frightening dinosaur sounds in the film? Some of the sounds are from tortoises mating!</span>\r\n<h3>Must Watch:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-WSsQstq-0[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>8. Aladin’s character is inspired by which Hollywood actor?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The famous animated Disney film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aladin</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> narrates the story of a princess who falls in love with a very handsome and charming Aladin. So, for the on-screen portrayal of Aladin’s character, the makers of the film turned towards Hollywood for the perfect face that could inspire the looks of the character.

Arriving Jan 2021’. It gave us glimpses of the actress’ baby bump as well as the stunning pregnancy glow on her face for the first time.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We must say that Anushka’s polka-dot dress, as well as the Indian cricket captain’s wide smile behind her, were really cute. Both fans and their friends, colleagues showered this post with such loveable comments, congratulated and blessed them. This was in the month of August (2020) and according to the couple, the new member of their family will arrive in January 2021. So yes! We can get good news now at any time soon!</span>\r\n<h2><b>Such an admirable journey of love</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to belonging from completely different backgrounds, Anushka and Virat didn’t know one another from much before.

After almost 3 years, news of Anushka’s pregnancy made all her fans and admirers really happy.</span>\r\n<h2><b>The ‘slaying’ Anushka!</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to making this big declaration, Anushka and Virat had spent quite a good time with each other in the self-isolation period. And it was evident from their social media posts. From playing cricket on the terrace to enjoy with their pet dog, the pair utilized the lockdown period the most to grow closer to each other. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through all these months, Anushka Sharma pregnancy pics ruled over the internet. We can say that this actress-producer just slew the maternity game and set goals for all the ‘going-to-be’ moms.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My personal favourite is the one she shot with VOGUE India, the one in which she appeared as a ravishing flawless Indian beauty in a green one-piece dress. In another beautiful picture taken in a pool, we saw Anushka wearing a black jumpsuit. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The happy and content pregnancy glow in her face is worth noticing in this picture and trust me, it couldn’t be expressed in words.

Seems like the ambitious actress for the time being has involved herself fully in building a perfect family. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though she has started with her producing ventures including the <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/paatal-lok-review-story-actor-director/\">Amazon series Patallok</a> and the Netflix film Bulbul. In the meantime, Virat has continued with his cricket matches, while Anushka had in fact, accompanied her husband in his IPL matches in Dubai to support and cheer for RCB.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actress has been keeping herself fit and fine during the pregnancy period. She has been a real inspiration to all young or would-to-be moms. In an Instagram picture dated 1 December 2020, we saw her doing Sirshasana. According to Anushka, yoga is a major part of her life. And of course, about the Sirsashana, she wrote that it was entirely under the supervision and guidance of her yoga teacher.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the picture Virat Kohli, who is the most loving, caring and the responsible husband was seen providing his wife such gentle and required support to balance for ensuring her extra safety.</span>\r\n<h2><b>The </b><b><i>Band</i></b> <b><i>Baja</i></b> <b><i>Baraat</i></b><b> actress works out on a treadmill during the 9th month of pregnancy.

It depends on individual capacity about how much physical stress a woman can take during pregnancy. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being an actress, workouts and exercises have always been a part of Anushka’s life. Hence she is able to do it smoothly even in the 9th month of pregnancy.</span>\r\n<h2><b>3rd year of the commencement of the beautiful journey done and dusted?</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4214 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Anushka-Sharmas-pregnancy-4.jpeg\" alt=\"Anushka and virat love\" width=\"720\" height=\"895\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On 11th December, the couple celebrated their third marriage anniversary.

Later in 2003 she appeared in a Bengali film </span><strong><i>Bhalo Theko</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and finally got the chance to make her Bollywood debut with the role of Lalita in Pradeep Sarkar directed </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parineeta</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Her in Hum Paanch:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMDZDxT3jXI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>Yami Gautam | Actresses From Small Screen to Bollywood</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4226 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.jpg\" alt=\"Yami Gautam Actresses From Small Screen to Bollywood\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking about TV actors who became movie stars, Yami Gautam’s name truly deserves a mention.

Fantasy movies make us travel to a world that is so different from ours yet the emotions are so similar to those we possess. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this list, I will write about the top 30 fantasy movies that cinephiles should include in their watch-lists. </span>\r\n<h2>30. Season of The Witch (2011) | Best Fantasy Movies</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 5.4</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Dominic Sena (Also Directed Swordfish, Gone in 60 Seconds)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Nicolas Cage, Ron Perlman, Christopher Lee, Claire Foy</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Max Go, DIRECTV, Cinemax Amazon Channel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4244 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Season of The Witch (2011)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Two rough Knights from the Crusades go on a mission to exorcise a witch who is held responsible for the black plague. But at the ultimate moment, they realize what they are dealing with might be more than just a witch.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This movie was highly inspired by the 50s movie ‘The Seventh Seal’. ‘Season of The Witch’ tells the story of brave men dealing with their own demons side by side fighting with a real one.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6QY5LOa6MM[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nicolas Cage had to learn horse-riding for this movie.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>29.

Sounds like a party, right? In the movie ‘League of Extraordinary Gentlemen’— all these characters are gathered together as a team to fight a mysterious villain called M. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The characters of this movie itself are an ultimate fantasy for everyone. Those who like to watch team-gathering fantastic movies will definitely enjoy it.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3lwgm7ORM8[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Facts: </b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Last known feature film directed by Stephen Norrington.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is the final live-action and only based-on-a-comic movie by Sean Connery. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>28. The Brothers Grimm (2005) | Best Fantasy Movies</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 5.9</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Terry Gilliam (Also Directed 12 Monkeys, Brazil)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Matt Damon, Heath Ledger, Lena Headey, Monica Bellucci</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> CBS, PlutoTV</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4246 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Brothers Grimm (2005)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The great Grimm brothers who are known as the greatest fairy tale collectors in history are portrayed as con-artists in this movie. On their journey, they come to encounter a village suffering from a curse.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This movie is practically a combination of several Grimm Brothers stories: The Red Riding Hood, Hansel &amp; Gretel, Snow White. And watching Lena Heady playing any other role than Cersei Lannister is very refreshing.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfXQpg5m0iI[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Facts:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The whole shooting of this movie was done in the Czech Republic.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Uma Thurman was offered the role that was later played by Monica Bellucci.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Johnny Depp was first selected for the role ‘Will Grimm’. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>27. The Great Wall (2016) | Best Fantasy Movies</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 5.9</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Yimou Zhang (Also Directed House of Flying Daggers, Curse of the Golden Flower)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Matt Damon, Tian Jing, Willem Dafoe</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> FuboTV, FXNow</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4247 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Wall (2016)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The plot is set in China about some alien monsters attacking the citizens and eating the citizens. William (played by Matt Damon) is a mercenary warrior, who helps the state army to defeat these monsters.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Remember on the 89th Oscars, host Jimmy Kimmel made fun of Matt Demon about how he gave away the leading role of ‘Manchester by The Sea’ to his best friend’s brother, and instead, he went to work on a movie in China? Well, this is the one. The Great Wall may not be as aesthetic as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Manchester by The Sea</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> but as a Fantasy movie, it surely counts.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avF6GHyyk5c[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is the most expensive Chinese feature film ever made.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>26.

And ‘Greek Myth in Modern Times’ is the motto of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Percy Jackson and The Olympians</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Percy is a Demigod who was unaware of the fact. After he found out who he was, he also came to know that there were many people like him and what’s more, there is a school for Demigods! After attending the school he made a few friends and came to face many possible problems and adventures.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The combination of myth, modern technology, and the new presentation of the characters take these two movies to a new level.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNhV8dk6W2M[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Facts:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians: The Lightning Thief (2010) is one of the very few movies where Sean Bean doesn\'t die or go to jail. (Poor him)</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Brie Larson auditioned for the role that Alexandra Daddario played in the movies.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>25. The Sorcerer’s Apprentice (2010) | Best Fantasy Movies</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 6.1</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Jon Turteltaub (Also Directed, National Treasure (1 &amp; 2), While You Were Sleeping)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Nicolas Cage, Jay Baruchel, Teresa Palmer, Monica Bellucci</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Disney Plus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4249 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Sorcerer’s Apprentice (2010)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A great evil has returned from the past and only Merlin’s true progeny can defeat him. What is special about this movie is the visual effect. It’s very clean, sharp and neat. The master-student chemistry between Balthazar and Dave is one of the best parts of this movie. There is humor, action, magic, and suspense— what’s more to ask for?</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2uV0_1C4UM[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Facts:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A song by ‘One Republic’ is played in the movie. The title is called ‘Secrets’. (It’s a very nice song. Check it out on YouTube) </span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Brie Larson auditioned for the role that Theresa Palmer played in the movie.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>24.

It was also his last Christmas movie review. (Rest in peace)</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is the last DreamWorks movie that was distributed by Paramount.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>22. Dorian Gray (2009)</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 6.3</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Oliver Parker (Also Directed Johnny English Reborn)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Ben Barnes, Colin Firth, Rebecca Hall</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> FMovies</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4252 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/9-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Based on the classic novel by Oscar Wilde, Dorian Gray is the story of a man named Dorian Gray who hides his age, inner demons, and ugly deeds in his self-portrait. The original sin is flowing through the human blood, given the perfect opportunity, a man can turn into the ugliest being on the inside no matter how handsome he looks on the outside.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVbdd8oOwOY[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ben Barnes was an excellent choice for this movie. With his handsome looks and good acting, he took this movie to another dimension.</span>\r\n<h2>21. Alice in Wonderland (2010)</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 6.4</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Tim Burton (Also Directed Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Johnny Depp, Mia Wasikowska, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Disney Plus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4253 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10.jpg\" alt=\"Alice in Wonderland (2010)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is impossible to create a list of fantasy movies and not include Alice in Wonderland in it. The name of this itself has now been a term for the genre of fiction where a person suddenly lands on a parallel or fantasy world. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A movie directed by a Fantasy Master, Alice in Wonderland adds something more than the book. The movie is scary and unpredictable sometimes which makes it a must-watch for fantasy lovers.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9POCgSRVvf0[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Awards and Nominations:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The movie won two Oscars. One in the category of Best Achievement in Costume Design and the other in the category of Best Achievement in Art Direction.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was also nominated in the category of Best Achievement in Visual Effects.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is the 7th work of the Burton-Depp duo.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>20. The Spiderwick Chronicles (2008)</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 6.5</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Mark Waters (Also Directed Freaky Friday, Mean Girls, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Freddie Highmore, Seth Rogen</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Netflix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4258 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-2.jpg\" alt=\"The Spiderwick Chronicles (2008)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the Grace family moves to an old house after Mr. and Mrs. Grace goes through a very bitter divorce, the kids learn that they are not alone in the house. And the forest behind the house is not an ordinary forest either. Then they discover a century-old secret about fairies, goblins, and many other magical creatures. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">‘The Spiderwick Chronicles’ is an underdog in the genre when it comes to fantasy movies. So the movie watchers will surely find a hidden gem watching this movie.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99bp9SOhcQ[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>19. The Lovely Bones (2009)</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 6.7</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Peter Jackson (Also Directed Lord of the Rings, King Kong)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, Susan Sarandon, Saoirse Ronan, Stanley Tucci</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Max Go, Cinemax Amazon Channel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4259 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-2.jpg\" alt=\"The Lovely Bones (2009)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Susie Salmon (played by Saoirse Ronan) was 14 years old when she was killed by a pedophilic serial killer. Now Susie is stuck in purgatory and can’t go to heaven because she feels like she has some unfinished business— that she can’t do anything about her father’s pain, that she never had her first kiss, and that her killer is still out loose.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I must say, The Lovely Bones is a very unique movie on this list. Because other than fantasy, this movie also falls into the genre of Thriller, Drama, and Mystery. It’s also a big-all-star-cast movie. Most of the main characters are all Oscar-nominated actors and actresses.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9PrQmcV81Y[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Awards and Nominations:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stanley Tucci was nominated for The Best Actor in A Supporting Role in the Oscar for this movie.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Best Fantasy Movies | Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryan Gosling is selected for the role that Mark Wahlberg played in the movie. Ryan bailed just three days before the movie saying he was too young to play the father of a teenage girl. He was 26 at that moment. Wahlberg was finalized for the movie just the day before the shooting started.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>18.

Miss Peregrine\'s Home for Peculiar Children is based on the novel by Ransom Riggs. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Miss Peregrine (Played by Eva Adams) runs a home for children who have unique features and abilities. When Jacob\'s (Asa Butterfield, you definitely know him from Sex Education as Otis or from the movie The Boy in Striped Pajama) grandfather dies mysteriously, he starts to find connections between the Home and the sorrowful incident. With time traveling, a lot of monster-slayings, and Samuel L. Jackson as the villain, this movie is undoubtedly one of the best fantasy movies all the time.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV_IhWE4LP0[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Timothee Chalamet auditioned for the role that Asa Butterfield played in the movie.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>17.

It is the kids or someone else?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">‘A Series of Unfortunate Journey’ is a dark fantasy playing with the fortunes and misfortunes of three siblings.

But truly speaking, Maleficent is not a villain at all. She is just a broken hero. The betrayal of a loved one at a very young age made Maleficent hate humans. But when it comes to a human baby who she, herself, has cursed to eternal sleep, motherly feelings can not stay away for very long.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this movie, a fairy tale villain has been portrayed in a way the world has never seen before. With the help of amazing costume design and make-up, Angelina Jolie’s acting looked so magnificent and enchanting that the movie won the critic\'s hearts.

The 90s kids will surely be hit with a surge of nostalgia because this was a part of our childhood where there was no internet or Facebook.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With Robin Williams as the central character, this movie is a classic fantasy movie. Though a few other actors were considered for the role, Robin Williams was specially chosen because of his power to improvise. And he absolutely stole the whole show with his amazing performance.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrlMYIYt-SI[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Facts:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scarlett Johansson auditioned for the role that Kirsten Dunst played in the movie.

This may be a horror fantasy movie but it’ll certainly give you the vibe of a detective movie too. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before I first watched this movie, I had only seen Depp’s Pirates of the Caribbean before. So without the beard I hardly recognized him and that was really the first time I realized how handsome Johnny Depp is.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RsKwn_Je1k[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Awards and Nominations:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Won the Best Art Direction-Set Decoration at the Oscars 2000.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The movie was also nominated in the categories of Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Facts:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Christopher Walken has no line in this movie.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Christopher Lee\'s only scene in this movie is before the opening credit.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>12.

It’s the emptiness of the heart.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">‘The NeverEnding Story’ beholds a beloved novel and exhibits the warm kind nature of a child’s imagination.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeFni9dOv7c[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<b>Fun Fact:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is the first film directed by director Wolfgang Petersen in the English Language.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>7.

But, more than the story itself, which creates a lasting impact on the audience in the making of a film. A Hindi film makes a remarkable mark in Bollywood and is remembered for years only when it can create a grip over the audience by its powerful making. It solely depends on the filmmaker, aka, the film Directors in Bollywood that how he makes and evolves the movie productions.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, can we say who is the no 1 director in India or who is the most successful director in Bollywood? Bollywood is a treasure house of movie directors with great potential. We definitely cannot consider only one of them as the best Hindi film director. Some directors have slain in a certain genre while others may have earned fame by making films in some other genre.

This great filmmaker left us in the year 2012. But even today Bollywood, as well as the audience, never fails to honour him because of his lifetime precious contributions to Indian cinema.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. </span><b>Sanjay Leela Bhansali</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4796 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-4.jpg\" alt=\"sanjay leela bhansali\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winner of 11 Filmfare awards, Sanjay Leela Bhansali has given many superhits since the 1990s.

Just a debut and they become a national crush. On the other hand, for most of the <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/nepotism-and-favouritism-in-bollywood-star-kids-vs-outsiders/\">outsiders</a>, it’s a different scenario. Years of hard work in the industry and still not able to achieve the targeted destiny and the expected appreciation has been the fate of many talented actors and actresses.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s time when we should promote the real treasures Bollywood has. Whether star kids or outsiders, instead of just looking out for pretty faces, we should go ahead. Hence, Tv Freak presents to you a list of underrated Bollywood actors and actresses, who deserve a lot more:</span>\r\n<h2><b>Divya Dutta</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4809 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/underrated-actors-and-actresses-in-Bollywood-1.jpg\" alt=\"Divya Dutta\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Divya started her career in 1994 with the Hindi film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ishq Mein Jeena Ishq Mein Marna</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Since then, she has been cast in several significant roles in movies like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baghban, Veer Zaara, Aaja Nachle, Special 26, Delhi 6, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose – The Unforgettable Hero, Gippi, Badlapur, Blackmail, Traffic, Manto, Fanney Khan, Music Teacher</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Divya has always been a versatile actor in the industry and be it an art film or commercial movie, she has aced each role with so much ease.</span>\r\n<h3>A Short n Sweet movie of her:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKyXUJceZ6k[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these facts, Divya didn’t achieve the deserved recognition in Bollywood as an A-list actress. Apart from movies, in 2020, she has blessed the OTT platforms with her superior acting skills. Her performances in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hotstar </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special OPS</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hostages Season 2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gained immense appreciation.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Ranveer Shorey</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is really saddening that one of the finest actors of Bollywood, in spite of his years of contribution to Indian cinema, is still on the underrating list. In a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hindustan Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> interview Ranveer spoke about this, ‘I still think the really big filmmakers are not keen to cast me’.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4810 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/underrated-actors-and-actresses-in-Bollywood-2.jpg\" alt=\"Ranveer Shoray\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has always stolen the show with his remarkable performances in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mixed Doubles, Pyar Ke Side Effects, Traffic Signal, Titli, Death in the Gunj, Moh Maya Money, Lootcase, Sonchiriya.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But sadly, despite sharing the name with legendary actor Ranvir Singh, Ranvir Shorey failed to grab the spotlight.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> [embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzm6Xcqdhf0[/embedyt]</span>\r\n<h2><b>Gulshan Devaiah</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another underrated but exceptionally talented actor in Bollywood, whose name deserves a mention here is Gulshan Devaiah. He has been working in the industry for more than a decade now. But still fails to enjoy the limelight of a lead actor.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4811 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/underrated-actors-and-actresses-in-Bollywood-3.jpg\" alt=\"underrated actors and actresses in Bollywood (3) Gulshan Devaiah\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After being a major part of the Bollywood movie </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shaitan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2011, Gulshan has portrayed varied roles in films like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hate Story, Goliyon ki Rasleela Ram-Leela, Hunter, A Death in the Gunj, Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota, Commando 3, Unpaused, Ghost Stories. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, his lead character of a suicidally depressed lad, Nakul in Amazon Prime series </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afsos </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">felt so realistic and touched our hearts.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> [embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR5eZfigiLo[/embedyt]</span>\r\n<h2><b>Amrita Puri</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possessing superior acting skills, Amrita Puri has slain in major supporting roles in movies like Aisha and Kaipoche. But despite being a good, natural actress, she was never given opportunities in big banner films and remained as one of the most underrated Bollywood treasures.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4812 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/underrated-actors-and-actresses-in-Bollywood-4.jpg\" alt=\"Amrita Puri\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She proved her talent in OTTs with her episodic roles in web series like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stories by Rabindranath Tagore</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Made in Heaven</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We really wish Bollywood to realize her worth and make her appear in more significant works.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j2fwEUH6Jw[/embedyt]</span>\r\n<h2>Saurabh Shukla</h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4813 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/underrated-actors-and-actresses-in-Bollywood-5.jpg\" alt=\" Saurabh Shukla\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the iconic role of Kallu Mama in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Satya</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the Masterji of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chaalang</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Saurabh Sukhla never failed to impress us with his acting timings. He has been seen as highly supporting the lead actors in movies like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jolly LLB, Kick, PK, Jagga Jasoos, Baarfi, Bala, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and so on. such a great actor he is but still, now he has not able to touch that level of popularity like other actors of his time.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgNCy__LvfY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Shreyas Talpade</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the other </span><b>most underrated Bollywood actors</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who don’t deserve to be so, Shreyas Talpade’s name should be mentioned.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4814 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/underrated-actors-and-actresses-in-Bollywood-6.jpg\" alt=\"underrated actors and actresses in Bollywood (6) Sreyash Talpade\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being in the Bollywood industry since 2000, Sreyash got his first hit break with sports film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Iqbal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2005. In 2007, he shared the screen with Bollywood Badshah Shah Rukh Khan in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Om Shanti Om</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and was highly praised for his performance. But after that, he was somehow lost in the wave of newcomers in the industry and came in the list of underrated actors.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from Lakshman’s role in the Golmaal series, he was not seen in any such significant work.

Amazon prime will release the second season of The Family Man soon. The teaser is already out.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Have a look at The Family Man 2 teaser below:</b></h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQUSPmnRvw4[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>Manoj Bajpayee: F</strong>ans are Crazy about it and Waiting so long<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqbjaIXCt-M[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Why The Family man?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most awaited Bollywood web series of the year 2021 is coming soon now. This will be the second and next season of the funny spy web series-The Family Man after the first one created by Amazon Prime Video and the first season is very much loved by the people and Manoj Bajpayee is always excellent.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The series had been awarded many awards like best director, actor, actress, series, and dialogues, and all the dialogues were well written by Raj Nidimoru and performed by a talented cast. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cast of this season is mostly the same like season one character Srikant Tiwari is portrayed by Manoj Bajpayee, character Suchitra Iyer Tiwari is portrayed by Priyamani Iyer, character JK Talpade is portrayed by Sharib Hashmi And there is one more addition of character Raji which will be portrayed by Samatha Akkineni, South Indian actress making her digital debut with a negative character in The Family Man season 2.</span>\r\n<h2>Checkout What Manoj Bajpayee and Crew Think about This Web series (Complete interview):</h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1-yaY28LQ0[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Last season </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So The Family Man is a story of a man working as an official Indian intelligence agency, whose name is TASC, who can’t juggle his work and family responsibilities. It also tells us how these unsung heroes work hard for the welfare of society.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4763 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Family-man-2-2023.jpg\" alt=\"The Family man 2 (2021)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the season centres around the terrorists who are linked to ISIS. They arrested these terrorists and investigated their plan, but they couldn’t stop them one of the terrorists ran away and executed the plan. After an exhausting chase of that terrorist one of the intelligence agents is relieved to find the terrorist dead, thinking that his plan of toxic gas leak foiled.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we look a little further into this the plan was already active with the pressure of gas causing it to leak. Officers who were in the factory tried to inform this but their calls missed. They hold on till here in the last episode.</span>\r\n<h2><b>What’s next?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview, The Family Man co-creator Raj Nidimoru revealed that they had one more ending idea. In which, few of the officers would be having chai and they would also include the Indian flag at the back in the frame but the concluding scenes turned out so good that they concluded with a cliffhanger.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4762 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Family-man-2-2022.jpg\" alt=\"The Family man 2 (2021)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His statement gave us a hint that they have planned a save. One of the biggest question marks after the first season is only one. It is whether they will be able to save the city people from the dangerous gas leak or not. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The director has already given hints and almost revealed that season 2 deals with Srikant’s life. It will also be around his wife’s relationship with her colleague Arvind. And he revealed that season 3 might be set in a ‘post-COVID-19’ world.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Why is the trailer not yet released?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trailer for the second season is not yet released; it was supposed to release on 19 Jan at 12 noon but then the premier was deleted from YouTube. This is because the fans are more curious and excited.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some sources say that the trailer is delayed because of the movie Tandav controversy. But in my opinion, this is all marketing by Amazon prime. After the teaser was released so many people tweeted asking where Shrikant is.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are releasing the series in mid of Feb but I don’t think, so they would be able to because the trailer is not out yet. Minimum 20 days before they will release the trailer at least. So that, in that period of 20days they can do their promotion events.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Amazing Scene, The Lie Detector:</strong></h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFIsc30WZuI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>Best of The Family Man:</h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRaei7hSM00[/embedyt]','Most Awaited The Family man 2 (2021) Why Trailer Not Yet Released?','','publish','open','open','','most-awaited-the-family-man-2-2021-why-trailer-not-yet-released','','','2021-01-31 21:56:56','2021-01-31 16:26:56','',0,'https://www.thetvfreak.com/?p=4759',0,'post','',0),(4766,12,'2021-01-25 17:05:19','2021-01-25 11:35:19','<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4768 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Who-did-Varun-Dhawan-married-with-1.jpg\" alt=\"Who did Varun Dhawan married with (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Famous Bollywood actor, Varun Dhawan finally got hitched with his long-time girlfriend <a href=\"https://starsunfolded.com/natasha-dalal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natasha Dalal</a> on January 24, 2021. First of all, our heartiest congratulations on Varun Dhawan and Natasha Dalaal Wedding for embarking upon this beautiful journey of married life.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Who did Varun Dhawan Marry</b><b> with and </b><b>who is Natasha Dalal</b><b>?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Definitely, in the case of the legendary actor Varun we don’t need any introduction. Known for movies such as Student of The Year, Judwaa 2, Badlapur, October, and latest one <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/coolie-no-1-remake-trailer-reviews-ratings-star-cast-and-records/\">Coolie no 1</a> this charming actor has been one of our favourites from Bollywood.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4770 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Who-did-Varun-Dhawan-married-with-3.jpg\" alt=\"Who did Varun Dhawan married with (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But his wife is completely from a non-filmy background. Her father Rajesh is a businessman. Brought up in Mumbai, she did her schooling from there. For higher studies, she moved to New York. She pursued fashion designing. She is an eminent fashion designer today and owns a clothing line named Natasha Dalal Label.</span>\r\n<h2><b>The adorable story of love</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have known each other since schooling. They became good friends there and the journey started. Varun and Natasha were just friends at that age and didn\'t know what will happen in the future.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4771 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Who-did-Varun-Dhawan-married-with-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview, she opened up that they started dating. It was in their mid-20s. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is noted that it was a concert where they met again. Then they started going out together frequently. Finally, the beautiful thing happened between the couple and loving each other.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She told that he was not in the acting career at that time when they were seeing each other. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After sharing this relationship of love for years, they finally decided to make it official by tying this most beautiful bonding.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Why was Varun initially secretive about the relationship?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He never brought his personal life into the limelight until 2019 though there had been rumours all around about his relationship with her. They were together on dates and outings, but the couple didn’t admit their bonding status as public.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4769 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Who-did-Varun-Dhawan-married-with-2.jpg\" alt=\"Varun Dhawan and Natasha Dalaal Wedding\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had once spoken in a discussion about this. In his words, his lifemate wants a ‘normal life’. She is a shy kind of person and hence doesn’t prefer grabbing attention and unnecessarily come in the spotlight. Seems like the actor has always respected his better half’s choices and kept this not public until the right time.</span>\r\n<h2><b>When did their relationship finally become public?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the famous show of Karan (KoffeeWithKaran)) he told and admit it on the screen and admitted his love. And after that in an interview that he will be together with her and will be the soul mate her. Yes, he talked about his marriage.</span>\r\n<h2><b>The engagement confirming</b><b> Varun Dhawan marriage</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The duo got engaged to long back in 2018 and since then the news of their marriage kept surfacing over the internet. As per reports, their engagement was an extremely private ceremony in the presence of their close family members.</span>\r\n<h2>Varun Dhawan and Natasha Dalaal Wedding</h2>\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CKeAVxjlxsQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\">\r\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CKeAVxjlxsQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by Zoom TV (@zoomtv)</a></p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last Sunday, the lovebirds officially became husband and wife. The wedding ceremony was held in Maharashtra’s town, Alibaug at a beautiful resort named The Mansion House. The white-coloured lavish and exotic venue was expectedly costly, about 4 lakhs per night! Their marriage was quite a private event that took place in the presence of only 40-50 invitees including family members, close friends, and colleagues. There was maximum security outside the wedding venue to keep it as much private as possible and to ignore unnecessary intervention from the media.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Strict COVID-19 regulations followed in the Varun Dhawan and Natasha Dalaal wedding venue?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> COVID-19 protocols were strictly followed in the Varun Dhawan and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Natasha Dalal marriage. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, the marriage venue was intentionally chosen 120 km away from the city of Mumbai.

With her dark brown coloured hairs, dark black eyes, a perfect figure accompanied by sharp features, Pooja is the definition of a true Indian beauty</span>\r\n<h2><b>Early life</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Mumbai-based actress and model are originally from a Punjabi family. In her teenage years, she always aspired to become ‘Miss India’. But like in any other conservative family, her desire was something that couldn’t be approved. So, Pooja completed her school education at St. Xavier’s High school.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post that, she obtained her engineering degree in biotechnology from Dr DY Patil University. To bear her family expenses, she started to try her hands in different jobs in the corporate world. But of course, for someone who always dreamt of belonging from the glamorous world of modelling and acting, jobs such as in BPO or as a high school Biology teacher couldn’t yield satisfaction.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Dreams do come true</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Pooja was going through this confusing phase of her career, the beauty pageant of ’<strong>Miss Queen of India</strong>’ was held. She decided to take a chance and participated in it. As destiny planned, in the year 2011, Bamrah won the pageant.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5387 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Pooja-Bamrah-wiki-___Biography-and-other-interesting-facts-3.jpg\" alt=\"Pooja Bamrah wiki ___Biography and other interesting facts (3)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, she was still involved with her academic career and was preparing to appear for MBA entrance examinations. It was a tough decision to leave the academic field entirely. But then, Pooja’s dream came true when she got her first fashion show with Storm Fashion and walked on the ramp.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, her journey began as a model. Shows after shows – she had already chosen modelling as a full-time career. Pooja admitted that she is aware of the competition and rivalry in the industry. But definitely, those things can never hold her back.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Pooja Bhamrrah as mids queen of India 2011</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30buxaJddk0[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>And then acting happened – Pooja Bhamrrah serial - Pooja Bamrah movies and TV shows</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the actress’s words, ‘I had never thought I’d take up acting.’ But again, her talent made her get the first show as a lead on Channel V’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Yeh Jawani Tera Riri</strong> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in 2014.

I must say, His House is one of the most unique Hollywood horror movies of 2020.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It exhibits the horror that hunts the immigrants, who have yet to get used to the past, the present, the house, the new culture, and the uncertain future. It is the story of two refugees surviving after survival.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYY0QJhlXjc[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>18.

The Old Guard is an adaptation of a comic book that goes by the same name. The movie is about a group of immortal mercenaries.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The source of their immortality is their inhumane capability to regenerate. They have been living for centuries and accomplishing missions for the sake of humankind. But when a new mission comes, it will be hard for them to survive through all the betrayal and life-threatening danger. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is a cliffhanger in the movie. So there might be a sequel coming.</span>\r\n<h3>Fun Facts:</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is one of the most successful Netflix original films. </span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is one of the most-watched movies on Netflix.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK-X2d0lJ_s[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>17.

It was also one of the most-watched movies on Netflix 2020. The movie is directed by Sam Hargrave, who previously worked as <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/best-movies-of-chris-evans-except-mcu/\">Chris Evans’s</a> stunt double in the MCU movies. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The plot of the movie is not very unique and does not dip in too deep. But the movie is visually satisfying when it comes to the action sequences.</span>\r\n<h3>Fun Fact:</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is the debut film of Sam Hargrave as a director.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6P3nI6VnlY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>15. Becoming</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 6.8</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: Nadia Hallgren</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast</strong>: Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5037 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-Netflix-Original-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-6-1.jpg\" alt=\"Becoming Top Netflix Original Hollywood Movies of 2020 (6)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another documentary in this list, this film is based on the book tour of the book ‘Becoming’ written by the former first lady Michelle Obama. The movie simply highlights the insights of how Michelle Obama connects with people, her naturality, hope, and ambition.</span>\r\n<h3>Awards and Nominations:</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This documentary feature was nominated for 4 Primetime Emmys.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wePNJGL7nDU[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>14. The Boys in the Band | Netflix Original Hollywood Movies of 2020</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating</strong>: 6.8</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: Joe Mantello</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast</strong>: Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto, Matt Bomer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5038 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-Netflix-Original-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-7-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Boys in the Band Top Netflix Original Hollywood Movies of 2020 (7)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The story of this movie starts with a party that leads to a massacre and ends with a lot of confessions about past loves. A group of gay men of the late 60s forthcoming with the feelings and reliving the friendship and love.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">‘The Boy in the Band’ is a remake of a 1970s movie that goes by the same name. The movie starred Jim Parsons whom you may know as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sheldon Cooper</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> from the sitcom</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The Big Bang Theory.</span></i>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=862Pb9oDDAo[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>13. Hillbilly Elegy</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 6.7</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: Ron Howard (Also Directed Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man, Rush)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast</strong>: Amy Adams, Glenn Close, Freida Pinto</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5039 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-Netflix-Original-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-8.jpg\" alt=\"Hillbilly Elegy\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hillbilly Elegy is a true story of J.D. Vance about his tragic family life, a drug-addicted mother, and sad childhood.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though the movie mostly reflects the struggles and troubles J.D. Vance has to go through growing up because of all the family melodrama, I would like to say, it is also a story of a mother who failed herself and her children repetitively because of irresponsibility. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The skillful acting of the stars in this movie takes this movie to another level. So there is no denying that Hillbilly Elegy is one of the best Hollywood movies of 2020.</span>\r\n<h3>Fun Fact:</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is director Ron Howard’s first time working together with a female cinematographer.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrlmlDWu5ag[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>12. The Half of It</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 6.9</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: Alice Wu (Also Directed Saving Face)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast</strong>: Leah Lewis, Daniel Diemer, Alexxis Lemire</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5040 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-Netflix-Original-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-9.jpg\" alt=\"Top Netflix Original Hollywood Movies of 2020 (9) The Half of It\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a small town like Squahamish, Ellie chu is a girl who is smart and different. She writes essays for other people in exchange for money. But one day a boy in her school comes to her demanding writing a love letter for cash. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Half of it is a <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-romantic-comedies-that-are-forever-in-our-hearts/\">romantic comedy-drama</a>. But that’s not half of it. The story of this movie is different and soothing which makes it one of the best Netflix original movies in 2020.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The whole idea behind this movie is about finding and accepting oneself, accepting new friendships in life, and realizing the impact of it.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-yhF7IScUE[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>11. Enola Holmes</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating</strong>: 6.6</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: Harry Bradbeer</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast</strong>: Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavill, Sam Claflin, Helena Bonham Carter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5041 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-Netflix-Original-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-10.jpg\" alt=\" Enola Holmes Top Netflix Original Hollywood Movies of 2020 (10)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Enola Holmes was one of the popular movies of 2020.</span></i>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The name ‘Enola’ comes from writing backward the word ‘Alone’. Now, why would a mother name her daughter with such a word? Does she want to curse her with loneliness? No, it is to mean that Enola will be alright when she is alone and on her own. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many of the audience of this movie got disappointed. To those, I want to say, this is not a canonical Sherlock Holmes movie. The plot is written by Nancy Springer and this story is solely focused on Enola Holmes, not the Holmes brother. This movie manifests feminism in a way that I have never seen before.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The movie is set in 1884 but Eudora Holmes is a mother who is way ahead of her time. We need mothers like her in every family to raise wonderful children of the future. Also, the ‘breaking the fourth wall’ scenes in the movies are really enjoyable.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though Sam Claflin played Mycroft in this movie, In real life he is younger than Henry Cavill who plays Sherlock in this movie.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d0Zf9sXlHk[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>10. The Devil All the Time</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating</strong>: 7.1</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: Antonio Campos</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast</strong>: Bill Skarsgard, Tom Holland, Sebastian Stan, Robert Pattinson</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5042 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-Netflix-Original-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"Top Netflix Original Hollywood Movies of 2020 (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you are seeing signs in everything, it is hard to detect if it is either from God or it was the devil all the time. PTSD from war, religious blindness, cringe-worthy violence are just some ingredients of this film. But Tom Holland’s acting was at a remarkable level in this film.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you want to experience how much of a good and color-changing actor Tom Holland is, you need to watch this movie. Also, you need to watch this movie because it is one of the top-rated Hollywood thriller movies of 2020.</span>\r\n<h3>Fun Facts:</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This movie is co-produced by Jake Gyllenhaal. </span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though Tom Holland is one of the highest-paid actors in this film, he does not appear in the first 46 minutes of it.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6XoWOUgCpo[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>9. Mank | Netflix Original Hollywood Movies of 2020</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 7.1</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: David Fincher (Se7en, Fightclub, Gone Girl, and <i> many other amazing movies</i>)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast</strong>: Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5043 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-Netflix-Original-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Mank\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mank is a biographical movie about Herman J. Mankiewicz. If you do not know who </span>Mank<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">iewicz is, he was a famous movie critic and screenplay writer. He won the Academy Award in 1942 for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) for the film Citizen Kane.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He also wrote the screenplays of The Wizard of Oz and The Pride of the Yankees. This movie manifests Mank’s writing progression of the timeless movie Citizen Kane.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We all know David Fincher from making hardcore thriller action movies. Mank on the contrary is a well-made drama-comedy that was appreciated by the critics and loved by the audience. So it is one of the best to watch Hollywood of 2020.</span>\r\n<h3>Fun Facts:</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Script of this film is written by the late Jack Fincher, David Fincher’s father.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This film honorably took place in Barack Obama’s favorite movie list.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The entire film is made in Black and White.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSfX-nrg-lI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>8. American Murder: The Family Next Door</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating</strong>: 7.2</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: Jenny Popplewell</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5044 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-Netflix-Original-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-3-2.jpg\" alt=\"American Murder: The Family Next Door\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This crime documentary features the murder of the Watts family. In 2018 the husband of the family Christopher Watts killed his pregnant wife and four-year-old daughter by himself in  Frederick, Colorado.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This film is made of archive footage.

She was awarded some 30 under 30 awards for writing plays. But lately, there have been no remarkable highlights in her career. When everyone around her is biased with racism and sexism, Radha thrived to go through a breakthrough by choosing a new way.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The whole movie is very entertaining.

Wolfe</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast</strong>: Viola Davis, Chadwick Boseman</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5047 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Top-Netflix-Original-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-6-2.jpg\" alt=\"Top Netflix Original Hollywood Movies of 2020 (6) Ma Rainey\'s Black Bottom\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though IMDb did not include biography as a main genre for this film, the main character of this film, </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Rainey\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ma Rainey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, was a real-life r&amp;b singer. The movie shows a recording event of Ma Rainey and her bandmates that gradually turns into chaos and disaster. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2020 was a very unfortunate year for us. And one of the most unrecoverable losses we had to go through is the death of Chadwick Boseman. So watching this movie will be an emotional ride.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Facts:</b></h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This film is produced by Denzel Washington.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The last movie by Chadwick Boseman. He left the world of living on August 28, 2020, after fighting an exhausting 4-year cancer. Rest in Peace.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ord7gP151vk[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>4.

It’s not a film about drug usages, match-fixing, or any of that sort.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is a story about a sexual predator who hides in the pure daylight by disguising himself as a national gymnastic team doctor. What’s so horrifying is that there is no way to identify these people before they get involved in crimes that will scar their victims for life.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzeP0DKSqdQ[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>3.

The real name of Crip Camp is Camp Jened. This film simply exhibits how a simple camp for the disabled becomes a utopia for the disabled spirits.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Influenced by many aspects, culture, and views, Crip Camp tells the story of how a camp became a positive activist and how it provides encouragement to those whose life has let themselves down.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrIs22plz0[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>2.

Her first film, opposite Bengali superstar Dev, was a sports movie Chaamp which surrounds the backdrop of boxing. It had a theatre release during the festival of Eid in 2017.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5154 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6.jpg\" alt=\"Rukmini Maitra movies\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch Rukmini Maitra Cockpit</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_WVnutAftY[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rukmini and Dev in an interview about Chaamp</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vAA3q-DWU8[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch her romancing co-star Dev in the song Jaya Tomari from Champ</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iZU2jYIieQ[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same year, she grabbed the female lead of another Bengali adventure movie Cockpit where she was seen as an air hostess. In the film, as a <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/successful-self-made-bollywood-stars-who-had-no-root-in-industry/\">newcomer</a>, her acting skills received much appreciation despite the presence of other much more experienced lead actors like Dev and Koel Mallik.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, Rukmini is 6-movies old which is not bad as a number, that too just within a span of 4 years.

Reportedly, they have met sometime back in the 1st decade of 2000 when the actress was just a student of class X. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rukmini Maitra and Dev, both reportedly have tattoos of their rumoured lovers’ names in their respective hands. Despite this, they have always avoided speaking of their relationship status or love life publicly. Though they are often seen in each other’s Instagram posts, such posts and captions are very professional and don’t give a glimpse of their relationship.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5158 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/10.jpg\" alt=\"Rukmini Maitra boyfriend\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rukmini once mentioned that the word ‘Dev’ instilled in her hand refers to ‘God’, implying it has no connection with her rumoured boyfriend.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, we are quite sure that the pair has a special bond.

But she was still in school at that time in class XI and wanted to focus on her studies, thus declining the offer.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If she had done the movie, maybe we would have a completely different Rukmini Mitra’s journey to narrate.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good dancer too!</span></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maitra never fails to impress us when it comes to dancing too.

Asides from being the support system of so many renowned shows in one place, it has now a support system for many great Indie movies and films over the years.\r\n\r\nSo I thought to myself, why not I make a list of some of the best independent <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-27-netflix-original-hollywood-movies-of-2020/\">movies on Netflix</a>. Note that these movies have low IMDB ratings but they are worth the watch. Today’s list will include some of the new indie movies of the past year. So Let’s Dive In!\r\n<h3>1. Project Power (2020)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb rating:</strong> 6</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Ariel Schulman</li>\r\n <li><strong>Starcast:</strong> Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon Levitt.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3900 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-2.jpg\" alt=\"Project Power Top 10 Hollywood Movies of 2020 (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nStarting with one of my personal favourites (despite the low IMDB Ratings), this movie is an interesting mix of mystery and Sci-Fi. Instead of dealers selling drugs, they happen to sell powerful pills, capable of giving the user many kinds of power, all based on their DNA.\r\n\r\nThe movie revolves around a former US ranger, formerly known to be subjected to many experiments, as an agency aims to make their breed of super-soldiers. By the passage of time, the Ranger lives on and raises a daughter. She happens to inherit many powers, due to his experiments.\r\n\r\nAs a result, she gets kidnapped by the agency and she becomes the subject of their experiments. This leads to a lot of havoc wrecking in different cities, which makes way to the city of New Orleans.\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Netflix.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw1vQgVaYNQ[/embedyt]\r\n<h3>2. Extraction (2020)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb rating:</strong> 6.7</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Sam Hargrave</li>\r\n <li><strong>Starcast:</strong> Chris Hemsworth, David Harbour, Randeep Hooda</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3905 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-7.jpg\" alt=\"Extraction Top 10 Hollywood Movies of 2020 (7)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nExtraction is one of the best indie films on Netflix, bringing us a unique and diverse cast, with an amazing story. It features Chris as the main protagonist named Tyler, a mercenary whose family is no longer with him due to reasons unknown.\r\n\r\nHe is assigned with the extraction of the Indian crime lord\'s son, who has been abducted by his Bangladeshi counterpart, as vengeance for a drug deal gone wrong. Tyler soon finds himself alone with his team shot down, the criminals in his pursuit, and the escort all terrified and helpless. Tyler himself in an alien environment where chances are merely slim.\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The Director of the movie happens to be formerly known for being the stunt double for Captain America.</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Netflix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6P3nI6VnlY[/embedyt]\r\n<h3>3. The Devil All the Time (2020)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb rating:</strong> 7.1</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Antonio Campos.</li>\r\n <li><strong>Starcast:</strong> Sebastian Stan, Robert Patterson</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3906 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-10-Hollywood-Movies-of-2020-8.jpg\" alt=\"The Devil All the Time Top 10 Hollywood Movies of 2020 (8)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nAntonio’s ‘The Devil All the Time’ features a psychological thriller with a mind-blowing star cast.\r\n\r\nThis thriller brings us to a small town where a young man named Arvin, realizes that the town he lives in has gradually become sinful and corrupted. It happens to have all sorts of sinful people; a sinful preacher, a corrupt yet selfish policeman, and a stalking cameraman (as shown from the trailer).\r\n\r\nThe movie ironically revolves around the phrase \"Some people were born so that they could be buried”. Although the movie gives the impression of a horror film, this movie is capable of making the audience look over their soul.\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Netflix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6XoWOUgCpo[/embedyt]\r\n<h3>4. Six Underground (2019)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb rating:</strong> 6.1</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Michael Bay.</li>\r\n <li><strong>Starcast:</strong> Ryan Reynolds, Adria Arjona, Corey Hawkins</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5277 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-2.jpg\" alt=\"Six Underground (2019)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nSo who would have thought that Michael Bay will be coming around the Netflix platform and come out with one of the best independent movies?\r\n\r\nThe fact that he produced one of the best Indie movies franchises like Transformers and then re-animated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with his film-making cunning, should be highly considered while expecting out of this movie as well. So the movie also features the sarcastic brilliance of Ryan Reynolds while he is the leader of six individuals.\r\n\r\nThese individuals are operatives who faked their death to become guns for hire. They put their free time to good use as they take down some of the most infamous influences from around the globe. They are only known by their numbers assigned to keep things strictly professional. This movie is very promising to bring the best auction possible for your home theatres or laptop screens.\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Just how Michael Bay keeps it very promising in his first movie outing with Netflix, the scenes of the crew in Turkistan was shot in Abu Dhabi. Furthermore, the soldiers involved in the movie belonged to the UAE Military.</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Netflix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0DO24Qy7jQ[/embedyt]\r\n<h3>5. The Old Guard (2020)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb rating:</strong> 6.6</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Gina Prince Bythewood.</li>\r\n <li><strong>Starcast:</strong> Charlize Theron, Harry Melling, Kiki Layne</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5278 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-2.jpg\" alt=\"The Old Guard (2020)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nAmong the best indie movies of 2020, The Old Guard is one of the underrated yet timeless movies of its kind. It features four immortal individuals, also guns for hire, who have lived for centuries in the fighting of many different wars and battles since they can remember.\r\n\r\nFast forward to the 21st Century, they find themselves across one of their own again but this time, they are now more unsure than aware whether they are even immortal anymore.\r\n\r\nThe plot discusses this mastermind who manages to uncover the truth about the old guard and they intend to bring them down for their desires. The action scenes are very promising and it almost resonates with an MCU like theme and environment. Better add this movie to your weekend list!\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Despite her age, Charlize still proves that age is just a number. The fact that she trained 3 to 4 hours per day to master all the fight scenes is truly extraordinary. It showed that Charlize truly put it all to her craft, ensuring all of us that the movie is worth the watch.</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Netflix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK-X2d0lJ_s[/embedyt]\r\n<h3>6. Avengement (2019)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb rating:</strong> 6.5</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> Jesse V. Johnson</li>\r\n <li><strong>Starcast:</strong> Scott Adkins, Kierston Wareing, Craig Fairbrass.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5279 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThe Arrangement is not your average Hollywood movie. This is another movie that features one of Hollywood’s well-known names, Scott Adkins, who decided to direct his movie. He plays the role of an inmate recently released from incarceration.\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around him (playing the role of Cain Burgess) who gets framed in a crime. He became a loose end for his older brother, who intends to kill him during his incarceration. But now, Cain goes after the people who were responsible for the plotting of his crimes.\r\n\r\nThis recent masterpiece will ensure that the action is promising, from a movie actor who mainly plays supporting roles in most of his cameos. He will ensure you to put you on a thrilling journey.\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Netflix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUQzHB8hs_s[/embedyt]\r\n<h3>7. Bright (2017)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb rating:</strong> 6.3</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director:</strong> David Ayers</li>\r\n <li><strong>Starcast:</strong> Will Smith, Joel Edgerton, Lucy Fry.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5276 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2.jpg\" alt=\"Bright (2017)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nSo these last Indie movies I will add to the list. It happens to be the very first Indie movie on the Netflix platform. This is the kind of movie which highlights a topic offensive in nature (Racism). But the irony of it all is that it does not offend any race at all.\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around three races; namely Humans, Orcs, and Elves. The movie shows how these races coexist together, with Orcs being the bottom of the food chain, the humans in the middle and the Elves being the superiors. With that out of the way, the story then focuses on the city’s police department, having a new Orkish recruit in their department.\r\n\r\nHe later goes on patrol with his partner (coming out of injury), who would then embark on this journey which brings the entire department onto its feet. They encounter dark elves, who wish to resurrect the Dark Lord and enslave all of the races. It’s up to the duo, who find a wand that can upset the entire world and all the races along with it.\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Despite the dull dialogues (and the chemistry) between the duo, the insane plot twists, and the bizarre theme of the movie, it is confirmed that the movie will get a sequel. However, the date for the sequel’s release is not confirmed yet.</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Netflix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EZCBSsBxko[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\r\nThe Netflix platform is a treasure with hidden gems. It brings movies worldwide to your mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. So these are the best indie movies on Netflix right now.

A situation of despair it was, and the whole world was scared, panicking and crying.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5134 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7dd50x600-1.jpg\" alt=\"Best Bollywood movies of 2020 that you can watch on Netflix and Amazon Prime\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the movie halls were shut down for social distancing issues and thus Indian audience thought that their sources of entertainment were also lost for indefinite months. But this was not the case when astonishing OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime were there. It can be rightly said that these OTTs gifted us with some best Bollywood works the previous year.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were able to watch, in fact, binge watches most of them, thanks to lockdown!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now when life almost came back to normal, situations improved, and even the vaccination arrived after a long wait, let’s go back a little. So here, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">TV freak</a> presents to you some of the best Hindi movies on Netflix as well as the best amazon prime Hindi movies 2020:</span>\r\n<h2><b>1. Ludo</b></h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srp90Hp0G70[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The maker of iconic movies like </span><strong><i>Barfi, Life in a Metro</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Anurag Basu once again created magic on-screen in his latest release Ludo, undoubtedly one of the best Netflix original Hindi movies 2020. A startling story it is...where four different well-written narratives merge together after a series of events and twists.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This multi-starrer Hindi film amazingly tangles four different colours of the board game with the realities of life. It also didn’t fail to utilize the superior acting skills of actors like<strong><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/pankaj-tripathi-biography-movies-tv-and-awards/\"> Pankaj Tripathi</a>, Sanya Malhotra, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/fatima-sana-shaikh-biography-controversiesawards-and-movies/\">Fatima Sana</a> Shaikh, Rajkumar Rao, Adiya Roy Kapoor, Abhishek Bacchan, Rohit Sharaf, Pearle Maney.</strong></span>\r\n<h2><b>2. Thappad</b></h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBw_Eta0HDM[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, A theatre release in February, </span><b><i>Thappad</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, later became one of the </span><b>best</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hindi movies on Amazon Prime 2020. The Tapsee Pannu starrer, a female-centric film, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thappad</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is also the story of a broken marriage. A story of happiness shared by two people destroyed by a single blow, a single slap, which is definitely not just a slap – the main backdrop of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thappad</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, Apart from addressing patriarchy, it bravely stands against many such Bollywood films that normalize or romanticize abuses or mistreatment against women by toxic heroes, in the name of love. The way various subplots of the movie like those of a single working mother Shivani; the tortured maid, Sunita; the ‘unhappy-in-marriage’ lawyer, Netra intertwined with the protagonist’s journey against a slap is worth-praising.</span>\r\n<h2><b>3. Axone</b></h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAW1U8PLwY0[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the list of Netflix Bollywood movies 2020, the next one that deserves a round of applause is the June release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axone</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The beauty of north-eastern culture accompanied by a beautiful plot with elements of love, friendship, emotions, internal struggle, and even racism has been perfectly shown by director Nicholas Kharkongor.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A simple realistic story surrounding a few north-eastern in Delhi finding difficulties in just arranging a wedding party due to their distinct culture has been so amazingly portrayed, Apart from the director, fabulous jobs have been done by underrated actors like <strong>Sayani Gupta, Vinay Pathak, Dolly Ahulia, Lin Laishram</strong> and several other significant and talented new arrivals in Bollywood.</span>\r\n<h2><b>4. Chaalang</b></h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-0SbSF2dE[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming back to Prime, another of the best Bollywood movies on Amazon prime 2020</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is <strong>Hansal Mehta</strong>’s honest attempt, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chaalang</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This perfect family watch revolves around the backdrop of the importance of sports and physical activities in a school’s curriculum, amidst everything.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few things like the ‘quite known storyline’ of guiding and preparing some noobs to win a conflict, an angle of love story, and formation of a love triangle, later on, seemed quite unnecessary in the film. But Hansal Mehta’s pragmatic direction with exact details, some of the dialogues, lifelike acting by <strong>Rajkumar Rao, Mohammad Zeeshan Zayuub, Saurabh Shukla, Ila Arun, Nusrat Bharucha</strong> makes the movie stand out.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 5. </span><b>Raat Akeli Hai</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the Bollywood Netflix Hindi movies 2020, a significant one that made a mark is the <strong>Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte</strong> starrer crime thriller </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raat Akeli</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hai</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc78PxSxXMg[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the shade of which seemed like a murder mystery, this movie is darker and went to the roots of violence against women. Though the screenplay seems quite slow at certain times, the strong acting, the environment of suspense and secrets with powerful direction and dialogues has the ability to rule out such loopholes. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nawazuddin Siddiqui slew in the character of a cop while the well-built female characters of suspects played by Radhika Apte, <strong><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/shweta-tripathi-biography-tv-shows-movies-and-commercial-ads/\">Shweta Tripathi</a>, Shivani Raghuvanshi</strong> did steal the show. A whodunit Bollywood murder mystery of a politician has a distinctiveness of its own in many ways.</span>\r\n<h2><b>6. Gulabo Sitabo</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ayushman Khurana, known for brilliant acting in movies addressing social issues, again impressed us with another mind-blowing performance in another such flavourful movie, </span><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/gulabo-sitabo-movie-2020/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gulabo Sitabo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></a>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0qeQ_yHqtA[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A story of greed, conflicts, and their outcomes along with some dark humour as well as saddening elements, have been very expressively represented by director<strong> Shoojit Sarkar</strong>.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A simple form of storytelling exploring quarrels of old, greedy, selfish man Mirza (outstandingly played by <strong>Amitabh Bacchan</strong>) and Baankey, his tenant (played by <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/ayushmann-starts-to-transform-physically-for-his-upcoming-movie/\"><strong>Aayushman</strong></a>) over an almost destroyed Haveli with Lucknow city being the backdrop, was a perfect movie to watch on a lonely lockdown afternoon.</span>\r\n\r\n[irp posts=\"937\" name=\"Gulabo Sitabo Movie (2020) | Trailer and Story\"]\r\n<h2><b>7. Chaman Bahar</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this Netflix release got few critic reviews like ‘uncomfortable to watch’, it received praises from most sections of the audience.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvBd0vhOkZI[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This small-town one-sided love story involving a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">paan-wala</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Billu and a minor girl from a higher middle-class family is one of my personal favourites because trust me...</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chaman Bahar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is not a movie where one-sided obsession has been romanticized. Rather, its harmful consequences form the climax of the film.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The impeccable act of the <strong>Panchayat</strong> famed <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/jitendra-kumar-life-biography-and-bollywood-journey/\"><strong>Jitendra Kumar</strong> </a>must be in the spotlight as he represented how small-town guys from poor families actually are, instead of depicting typical Bollywood heroes. It’s not just another Bollywood love story, rather a tale close to reality.</span>\r\n\r\n[irp posts=\"2353\" name=\"Jitendra Kumar | Life, Biography and Bollywood Journey\"]\r\n<h2><b>8. Bulbul</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another remarkable movie, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bulbul</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> met our high expectations and turned out to be one of such best Bollywood <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-27-netflix-original-hollywood-movies-of-2020/\">movies on Netflix 2020</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGReT9-cAg[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, In the light of the horror genre, this movie tells much more about oppression against women in a 19</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> century zamindar-dominated Bengal. ‘A woman is never weak; she can rise as a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">devi</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and fight back against the wrong’ – this strong message to patriarchy serves as the main motive of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bulbul</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, The film’s red filter creates an ideal mood or environment.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And finally, The brilliant direction by debutant director <strong>Anvika Dutt</strong> combined with flawless performances of <strong>Tripti Damri, Rahul Bose, Parambrata, Paoli Dam</strong> makes it the best female-oriented movie of the year.</span>\r\n<h2><b>9. Shakuntala Devi</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will it be wrong if I say that the female hero dominated Bollywood last year? </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shakuntala Devi</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the July release, is also one of the worth-watching Bollywood movies on Amazon Prime</span><b>.</b>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HA1HRufYso[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This <strong>Anu Menon</strong> directed inspiring biopic of ‘human computer’, Shakuntala Devi has some flaws of its own. But <strong>Vidya Balan</strong>’s iconic performance of a mathematical genius as well as, as a ‘somewhat flawed’ mother and a wife cancels out everything else. <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/sanya-malhotra-story-biography-and-movies/\"><strong>Sanya Malhotra</strong></a> and Jishu Sengupta also don’t lack behind to portray all the required emotions in their respective roles.</span>\r\n\r\n[irp posts=\"2097\" name=\"Sanya Malhotra | Story, Biography and Movies\"]\r\n<h2><b>10. Serious men</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another show stealer of <strong>Nawazuddin Siddiqui</strong> got an OTT release on Netflix in October 2020.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naXf8R1aOik[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on <strong>Manu Joseph’s novel</strong>, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serious Men</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> addresses the social issue of caste divide and narrates the tale of a frustrated middle-aged Dalit who involves himself in a lie by making people believe that his son is a science genius.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nawazuddin’s superior performance as the anti-hero as well as performances by <strong>Aakshath Das</strong> (child actor), <strong>Sweta Basu</strong> Prasad are noteworthy. All credits to the cast and crew for gifting us with such an impactful heart-breaking dark comedy of the year</span>\r\n<h2><b>11. AK vs AK</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a long wait and anticipation, one of the notable Bollywood Netflix Hindi movies 2020</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">got a Christmas release in the OTT. And you know that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A brave attempt like this has rarely been made in a Bollywood movie.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXZPMb51IQU[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An imagined extension of real-life famed artists like <strong>Anil Kapoor</strong> and <strong>Anurag Kashyap,</strong> an imagined feud between them leading to kidnapping and then its portrayal on-screen, the entire promising concept has driven audiences to give this movie a watch.</span>\r\n\r\n[irp posts=\"4296\" name=\" Best Directors in Bollywood and Their Successful Movies of All Time\"]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though put down by many critics, this Vikramaditya Motwane’s non-cringe black comedy kidnapping thriller by huge margin failed to dishearten the audience.</span>\r\n<h2><b>12. Unpaused</b></h2>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXGfGV2v6GE[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, In the ‘Amazon Prime movies list 2020’, it’s time to add the anthology film, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unpaused</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> consisting of 5 short films. Directed by <strong>5 different directors</strong>, it gives different perspectives on COVID-19 pandemic effects in the lives of various people.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, it has lots of relevance to the current situation. Next, it gives a closer view of reality. Successfully showing the outcomes of virus attacks in the forms of problematic issues like weakening of mental health, loss of jobs, loneliness, suicidal thoughts, this movie deserves a watch.</span>\r\n<h2><b>13. Subh Mangal Zaada Saavdhan</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A must-watch movie for Indian parents as well as for all those Homophobic people out there.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6r8UYU7Zcs[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The struggles of the queer community and their non-acceptance by society have been narrated engagingly in this 117 minutes long <strong>Ayushman-<a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/jitendra-kumar-life-biography-and-bollywood-journey/\">Jitendra</a></strong> starrer movie. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With some critics calling it ‘clunky’ or ‘erratic in parts’, I feel the film has been a very strong step towards this newly explored genre of ‘queer’ in Bollywood.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some parts may feel lacking expected humour or emotions, but again, watching the entire movie isn’t going to disappoint you. A theatre release, this film is now available on Amazon Prime.</span>\r\n<h2><b>14. Cargo</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an era of crime, thriller and mystery genres, this Netflix released sci-fi has been a fearless attempt by its writer-director <strong>Arati Kadav</strong>.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvpdN4VltKY[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story about a spaceship with a single crew member and also his new assistant gives an exciting perspective on life post-death.

Mainly, Saif Ali Khan, as well as debutant actress Alaya F, did fantastic jobs in this one-tie entertainer.</span>\r\n<h2><b>17. Dolly, Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitare</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another female-centric movie on Netflix!

But Mank has made it all possible. Mank has been a long term project for director Davin Fincher. He wanted to start shooting this film right after he was done with The Game (1997).</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary Oldman and Jodi Foster were his original choice of cast. Later Amanda Seyfried replaced Jodi Foster in this film who is almost a decade younger than her character.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mank is a great film about the progression of a great script-writer </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herman J. Mankiewicz</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and an era-defining movie Citizen Kane. It takes an outstanding team of cast and crews to pull off a movie like this perfectly. And Mank will be a great example of that.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mank has also been nominated in 5 other categories in the 78th Golden Globe Awards.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The script of this film has been written by David Fincher’s late father Jack Fincher, who has also been nominated for Best Screenplay — Motion Picture for this movie.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSfX-nrg-lI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4.

It’s about letting things go, things that are dearest to you but holding you back to move on with your life. When you live in a certain stable arrangement for a long time (For this film which is a workplace and house), it’s hard to imagine what life would be like outside that world.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to find yourself when your life revolves around that sort of settlement. This is what reflects on the life of the main protagonist of this movie.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nomadland is an adaptation of a non-fictional novel written by Jessica Bruder. With greatness and grace, this movie has already won the Golden Lion at the 77th Venice International Film Festival.

So when the rapist is about to get married, Cassandra rises from the ashes to get revenge on everyone who did wrong to her best friend.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promising Young Woman is a very dark thriller that manifests feminism quite strongly. It’s about how society fails a woman after she is raped and the rapist gets bailed out like nothing really ever happened. Carey Mulligan was shown as a femme fatale character in this film which was very refreshing. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie has 3 other Golden Globes 2021 nominations.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Facts:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margot Robbie and Carey Mulligan are two of the producers of this film.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Directorial Debut of Emerald Fennell for a full-length feature film.

He is hard to take care of because he is stubborn and refuses help from other people. His daughter Anne is very frustrated about this and is on the verge of losing her patience. The Father exhibits a feeling or a situation we want to avoid for the best.   </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Florian Zeller, whose most credits are earned from writing, made his dream film. Anthony Hopkins was his prime aim. He even named the main protagonist ‘Anthony’ in honour of Sir Anthony Hopkins. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Father has a total of 4 Golden Globes nominations this year.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Florian Zeller’s directorial debut for a feature film.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TZb7YfK-JI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>1.

The Trial of Chicago 7 is undoubtedly one of them.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie is based on a real-life event of 1968. 7 people were charged for initiating a riot at the protest of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. This movie shows the rise of the falsely accused convicts through judicial misconduct.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though all the 7 protagonists are Americans, most of the characters are played by non-Americans. That takes a lot of effort in the accent department to do the acting perfectly. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aaron Sorkin is the director of this film. He previously won an Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for the movie— The Social Network.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Trial of Chicago 7 has also been nominated for 4 other categories at this year’s Golden Globes.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second feature Film Directed by Aaron Sorkin.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsFCZ_B2o5w[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Conclusion:</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two Netflix Originals, both of them are biography films.

So, here <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">Tv freak.com</a> presents to you a close and detailed look at Massey’s inspiring life journey.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Vikrant Massey Early life</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vikrant Massey was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Like me and you, he is from a small, simple middle-class working family. His likeness and passion for acting and dancing started growing since the time he was very young. Speaking of education, his schooling was from Mumbai itself.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5210 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-1.jpg\" alt=\"vicky kaushal\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His acting basically began in his school days when he used to take part in various plays.  Besides these, he also took professional dance training and his dedicated dance performances also started mostly since he was only 7 years old.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 12th, Vikrant obtained his Bachelor’s degree from a college at his birthplace only.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had his teachers’ continuous encouragement from the beginning. This inspired and motivated him to choose the path of entertainment as a full-time career.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>So what\'s about Vikrant Massey Age, body, and Height?</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entering the world on 3rd April 1987, the actor is currently 33 years. With a height of about 5’9”, a pair of dreamy black eyes on an attractive face with the perfect jawline, he has a very charming appearance.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Let\'s know who are in Vikrant Massey family and friends?</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The acting was something that was not in Vikrant’s gene as he took birth in a complete non-filmy family to a couple, Jolley Massey (father) and Meena Massey (mother). He spent those days in just a 1BHK flat where the family used to reside. He is still lovingly and affectionately called Sonu by his close ones.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sonu is the second child of his parents. He has a brother elder to him. His name is Mohsin Massey.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5207 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-1.jpg\" alt=\"Childhood\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5208 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-1.jpg\" alt=\"Vikrant Massey Biography and other interesting facts\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding friendships, we are not very sure how much he is close to people from the Bollywood or TV industry, with whom he hangs out, with whom he does not. But a well-mannered Vikrant has always been seen laughing and spending good time with co-stars like Harleen Sethi, Shweta Tripathi, Ali Fazal, etc. in promotions or interviews.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Vikrant Massey Instagram handle also has pictures consisting of snaps from his promotions or posters of his films/web shows.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a few unprofessional pictures, we have seen him with Vicky Kaushal, Rhea Chakraborty, Shaan Muttathil, Tilottama Shome, Gulshan Devaiah, etc.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5209 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-1.jpg\" alt=\"Relationships\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post his work with Ranveer Singh, he was questioned about his equation with the star in an interview. To it, he replied, ‘Ranveer is a co-star, not a friend’.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seems like Vikrant has more close friends outside the industry. In a 2020 interview, he even spoke about losing a very close friend named Kushal Punjabi who ended his life by suicide.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5211 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-1.jpg\" alt=\"Vikrant Massey Biography and other interesting facts\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b>Beginning of the journey</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He took training in Ballet dancing professionally and was phenomenal in this field.

Today let’s get to know a little more about her journey from being a girl-next-door to being what we call ‘celebrity’.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Early life</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bharucha’s birth and then her growing up was in the commercial capital of India, Mumbai. The city is the witness of Bharucha’s transition from a child to a teen, and then to an adult.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her alma meter includes Lilavatibai Poddar High School and then the famous Jai Hind College where she spent her three years of graduation.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding acting, it seems like the actress had harboured a likeness for this field since a young age. In school, she was a vigorous part of theatre and dedicatedly delivered many on-stage performances.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Nushrat Bharucha age and physique</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this bubbly actress still looks like in her late twenties, she is already of almost 36 years. With a height of 5’4”, she has outstanding figure measurements of 34-25-34. Combined with a bewitching face and an alluring pair of dark black eyes, the way she carries herself is really graceful.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Nusrat Bharucha family and friends</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5222 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nusrat-Bharucha-biography-movies-family-and-other-interesting-facts-4.jpg\" alt=\"Nusrat Bharucha biography, movies, family, and other interesting facts\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bharucha is from a Muslim family with no connections in the film world. Being the only child, her parents, Tanvir Bharucha, a businessman, and Tasneem Bharucha had brought her up with immense care and affection. But they were kind of orthodox and initially didn’t want her to act in films.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5221 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nusrat-Bharucha-biography-movies-family-and-other-interesting-facts-3.jpg\" alt=\"Nusrat Bharucha biography, movies, family\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a happy-to-go person, Nusrat always gets along well with the people she works with. Hence, she has quite a good number of close friends in the industry.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Her Chaalang co-star <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/rajkumar-rao-sucks-a-condom-deleted-scene-from-the-movie/\">Rajkumar Rao</a> falls on this list and this duo has often been seen together in various events.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5223 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nusrat-Bharucha-biography-movies-family-and-other-interesting-facts-5.jpg\" alt=\"Nusrat Bharucha rajkumar rao\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She is also close to the Bollywood heartthrob, Kartik Aaryan. Apart from professional work also, they hang out together to spend quality time.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5224 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nusrat-Bharucha-biography-movies-family-and-other-interesting-facts-6.jpg\" alt=\"Nusrat Bharucha kartik aryan\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During shoots of the Bollywood movie, Dreamgirl, she had also posted a very fun BTS footage of Aayushman Khurana. Besides sharing a dazzling chemistry on-screen, these actors share a bond of friendship as well.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BTS from Dreamgirl posted by NB</span></h3>\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1JORrkFlsF/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\">\r\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1JORrkFlsF/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Nushrratt Bharuccha (@nushrrattbharuccha)</a></p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, her best friend is someone from outside the industry. In 2019, Nusrat has proudly played her bridesmaid\'s role (in real, not in the reel of course) and had slain the social media game.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Nusrat Bharucha TV shows</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5219 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nusrat-Bharucha-biography-movies-family-and-other-interesting-facts-1.jpg\" alt=\"Nusrat Bharucha biography, movies, family, and other interesting facts\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bharucha’s acting exploration started with a small screen in the Zee TV serial Kitty Party. The year was 2002. But then due to some reasons, she left the opera after a few months. She then did theatre for some more years and then finally started her journey in Indian cinema.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in 2010, we saw her magnificent performance in another TV series, Seven. That was aired on Sony Entertainment Television.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding Nusrat Bharucha web series, she hasn’t been a part of any such project and has made appearances in serials or films.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Nusrat Bharucha movies</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like any other artist, Bharucha also had ups and downs in her career. Her first Hindi film was Jai Santoshi Maa (2006) and then Kal Kisne Dekha which was released in 2009.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jai Santoshi Maa scene of NB</span></h3>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vto4cKiVkJY\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, her first breakthrough was the role of Shruti Dahiya in the critically acclaimed movie Love, Sex Aur Dhoka in 2010. The same year she made her debut in the Telugu film industry too with the film ‘Taj Mahal’. In 2011, she was a part of the multi starrer comedy film Pyar Ka Punchama, opposite Karthik Aaryan.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen to the beautiful songs from Tajmahal</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT7fy1FS6ps[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love sex or Dhoka trailer</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNxrPvqj9Yc[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch NB in Pyar Ka Panchama trailer</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ26AdrU4GM[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Till 2013, Bharucha did not achieve success professionally as two of her films Akkash Vaani and Darr @ Mall turned out to be unsuccessful.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">watch NB I Akkash Vaani movie scene</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6h0XW3IWP8[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But, she continued the struggle and ultimately Pyar Ka Panchama 2 in 2015 turned out to be the turning point of her career. It was loved by the audience and was her first big commercial success. It established her as a competition to contemporary Bollywood actors and gave her the deserved recognition.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch NB in Pyar Ka Panchama 2 trailer</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC-HGUhxyyc[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no turning back after 2015. From time to time, she has gifted us with some iconic blockbusters including Sonu Ki Tittu Ki Sweety and Dream Girl.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen to the gem Subah Subah from Sonu ki Tittu ki sweety</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgTKmRPWMq4[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2020, her two releases include Jai Mummy Di (cameo) and the sports drama Chaalang.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch NM in Chaalang trailer</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-0SbSF2dE[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 is most probably going to witness her major releases, including Hurdang, Chhori.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Appearances in music videos</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her first music video appearance was in Atif Aslam’s romantic melody, Baarishein in 2019. In the same year, she starred in Guru Randhawa’s Ishq Tera. She then featured in a song of the Siddharth Malhotra starrer, Marjawaan. She was last seen in 2021 in Yo Yo Honey Singh’s music video ‘Saiyan Jee’.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch her in Baarishein</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NfnFYpENo[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Other works</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has also done some modelling and has been featured on the covers of some famous magazines which include Femina Brides, Travel +leisure etc.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has also slain the ramp game and has walked the ramp for a few fashion weeks.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NB ramp walking video</span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evk2jMcoJb4[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have also witnessed her small-time screen appearances in advertisements of Flipkart and Cadbury DairyMilk Silk.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Relationship status</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nushrat’s name has once been linked with her co-star from 4 movies. Yes, we are talking about Kaartik Aaryan. But they never paid heed to such questions that were raised about their bond.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, Kartik Aaryan in an interview brushed away all the rumours. As per his words, the duo shares a very amazing relationship but he clarified that there is no such affair.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, like any other Indian mom, Nushrat\'s mother also cannot see her single for longer. In an interview, she confirmed that her daughter had been given enough time and now by any way they’re going to convince her to marry.

The Director is what is considered to be the heart of a movie. With his/her direction a movie takes the form of art. A great director can even make a movie timeless. It is the vision and guidance offered by a director that makes every moment of a movie worth watching. So let\'s take a look at the Golden Globe Nominations for Best Director 2021.</span>\r\n<h2><b>5. David Fincher | Best Director nominations</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Nominated For</strong>: Mank(2020)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast</strong>: Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform</strong>: Netflix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5234 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-Golden-Globe-Awards-Nominees-Best-Director-1.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Golden Globe Awards Nominees Best Director\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Fincher is a two-time Oscar-nominated director and when it comes to psycho-thrillers, it will not be exaggerating if I say, he is an auteur. His directorial debut was by the movie Alien³. Before that, he has directed countless music videos. His first breakthrough was by the movie Se7en which starred Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/5-most-loved-movies-of-gwyneth-paltrow-shakespeare-in-love/\">Gwyneth Paltrow.</a></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mank is the 11th and the latest feature film directed by David Fincher. The script of this film was written by his late father Jack Fincher. It is a biographical film about the life of Herman J. Mankiewicz.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I have mentioned before, psycho-thrillers are kind of his trademark, Mank as a drama-comedy biography is a very exceptional movie in his career and which he has pulled off smoothly with professionality and grace.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He is also the only veteran director in Best Director Nomination for Golden Globe Awards 2021.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Fincher has four previous Golden Globe nominations and one win in the category of Best Director.</span>\r\n<h3>Mank (2020) Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSfX-nrg-lI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4. Chloé Zhao | </b><b>Best Director nominations</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Nominated For</strong>: Nomadland (2020)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Frances McDormand, David Strathairn</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Hulu</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5235 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-Golden-Globe-Awards-Nominees-Best-Director-2.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Golden Globe Awards Nominees Best Director\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nomadland is about a woman who lost both her husband and job but is not ready to move on from the memories of either of them. But the reality is cruel and it forces her to move on nonetheless. This story is mostly about letting things go and adapting to a new life.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let\'s talk about the director. Chloe Zhao is a Chinese movie director who made her directorial debut in 2015 with the movie </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Songs My Brothers Taught Me</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Nomadland is her third feature film and this is her first time being nominated at the Golden Globe. She is also a nominee in the category of Best Screenplay - Motion Picture for this film. </span>\r\n<h3>Nomadland (2020) Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sxCFZ8_d84[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She is the director of the coming MCU movie The Eternals. </span>\r\n<h2><b>3. Emerald Fennell | Best Director nominations</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Nominated For:</strong> Promising Young Woman (2020)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Alison Brie</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> VUDU, DIRECTV</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5236 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-Golden-Globe-Awards-Nominees-Best-Director-3.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Golden Globe Awards Nominees Best Director\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An actress turned director. Or shall I say, an actress turned into a very successful director with just one try? When you look up Emerald Fennell’s IMDb profile, you will see most of her credits are for acting.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has played roles in various TV shows (The Crown, Call the Midwife) and movies (The Danish Girl, Pan). She has only two Directing credits, one is for a short film named </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Careful How You Go</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The other one is the one she’s been nominated for the best director in the 78th Golden Globe Awards. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I observe the concept of this movie, not just the plot also the making, I notice a strong chain of feminism. Women (referring to Margot Robbie and Carey Mulligan) helping a woman to make a film about a woman avenging her best friend who is also a woman.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emerald Fennell\'s great directing capability comes from her way of storytelling. She has already written scripts for a Golden Globe-winning thriller Drama series Killing Eve. Now that I have mentioned that, Killing Eve is also a series with strong female leads. I guess strong female leads and feminism will be Director Emerald Fennell\'s trademark.</span>\r\n<h3>Promising Young Woman (2020) Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i5kiFDunk8[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>2. Regina King | Best Director nominations</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Nominated For:</strong> One Night in Miami (2020)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Kingsley Ben-Adir, Eli Goree, Aldis Hodge</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Amazon Prime Video</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5237 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-Golden-Globe-Awards-Nominees-Best-Director-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another actress turned director. More likely, an Oscar, Golden Globe, and Emmy winning actress turned into a director. Regina King won both her Oscar and Golden Globe Award in 2018 for the movie </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Beale Street Could Talk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But unlike Emerald Fennell, Regina King is not a total newbie director.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She previously has directed some well-known TV series like Scandal, Shameless, The Good Doctor, and This Is Us. She has also directed a documentary and a TV movie. But, yes, this is her first time directing a full-length feature film.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Night in Miami is a fiction movie. But this fiction mixed up with reality and history. We are familiar with movies that unite famous fictional characters from different fictional universes within a common plot, like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for example.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Night in Miami is something similar to that, but the only difference is that instead of fictional characters, the protagonists in this movie are real historical figures. I am talking about Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, and Jim Brown. Which makes this movie way more interesting than any fiction. And I would say, by directing a movie with such a unique plot and setting, Regina King proved herself to be a real visionary.</span>\r\n<h3>One Night in Miami (2020) Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZprXMxKg--w[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>1. Aaron Sorkin</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>Nominated For</strong>: The Trial of Chicago 7 (2020)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast</strong>: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform</strong>: Netflix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5238 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-Golden-Globe-Awards-Nominees-Best-Director-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Trial of Chicago 7 is based on a true event film portraying 7 victims of wrongdoings and judicial misconduct in the late 60s.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aaron Sorkin is an Oscar Winning screenplay writer who won his Oscar in 2011 for the movie </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Social Network. David Fincher directs the Social Network</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and this year Aaron Sorkin is competing against him in the same category at the 78th Golden Globe Award. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Trial of Chicago 7 is Aaron Sorkin\'s 2nd film as a director. If we look at some previous works by him (both as a writer and a director), we can see most of his films are biographical or based on true events. For Example- The Social Network, Molly\'s Game, Charlie Wilson\'s War, Steve Jobs. His upcoming movie ‘Lucy and Desi’ is also a biography movie. I guess we have found his speciality.</span>\r\n<h3>The Trial of Chicago 7 (2020) Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsFCZ_B2o5w[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Conclusion:</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, One Chinese woman, one black woman, one totally newbie, one veteran, and one writer turned director— the Golden Globe 2021 nomination for best director could not be any more diverse.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, Each of these directors here presents the audiences with the amazing art of film making and their own exceptional way of storytelling. So let\'s wait for the main event and hope that may the best director wins.</span>\r\n\r\nFinally, Check out our best collection of movies here.

Double meaning Bollywood movies are those <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-adult-and-hot-movies-of-bollywood/\">adult comedies</a> that are advisable to never watch with Indian parents and families.

This is an anthology kind of film where four different stories of different times (ancient to modern) revolve around issues and desires related to women’s sexuality.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Hindi film is about an aspiring scriptwriter. He bases four stories of his script on a Panchatantra story in which a woman despite being caught intimately with her lover by the husband manages to decline the blame. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hilarious scenes from this Hindi film will make you laugh. But at the same time, the message it gives about gender inequality is worth praising. There are few negative responses from the critics but the fact that the erotic performances have been delivered so amazingly can’t be denied.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Achievements –</strong> Won 3</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rd</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Mirchi Music Awards in the category Raag Inspired Song of the year for song ‘Kaare Kaare Badra’.

But for its humorously erotic, non-offensive elements and non-judgemental approach towards the protagonists and other characters, it received excepted praises from the audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story is about a guy who does not believe in delicate feelings like love, instead harbours interests in only one-night stands. But the plot twist comes with the coming of a beautiful young girl named Tripti.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Achievements –</strong> Nomination for best debut director in Apsara Film Producers Guild Award</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Available on –</strong> Netflix</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtgcFOQLkH0[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b></b><b>3.

A boy and a girl enter a well-known university in China. Both are from the same small town and what’s more, they are neighbours. The girl is fearless and badass, and the boy is quiet and nerdy. We just have to wait and watch if the opposites do attract or not.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I greatly liked about this movie is the character of the female lead. Unlike any other typical rom-com movie, she is not clumsy, does not think out loud, has good self-confidence, and does not fall into humiliating disastrous situations.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will expect and predict her to make a public embarrassment of herself, but she won’t. There is also a small twist at the end. Overall, it is a very cute and romantic movie to watch this Valentine’s Day. </span>\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love the Way You Are</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is not a popular movie at all.

Maybe all these problems wouldn’t have been a great factor if she wasn’t a shopaholic. Yup, you read it right. She is a shopaholic, which means she has an uncontrollable desire to shop.

But it is a place known for breaking hearts as well. It is too common to find actor-actresses falling in love with their co-stars or cast members while working together. Sadly, most of them do not last very long. But enough of bad breakups. It’s <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/best-bollywood-romantic-movies-to-watch-on-valentines-day-2021/\">Valentine’s Day</a>, so let’s talk about Hollywood top 5 most romantic couples.</span>\r\n<h2><b>6. Isla Fisher and Sacha Baron Cohen </b></h2>\r\n<b>Movie Together: The Brothers Grimsby (IMDb Rating: 6.2)</b>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5361 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-4.jpg\" alt=\"Isla Fisher and Sacha Baron Cohen  Hollywood romantic couples\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Fisher (45) and Sacha Baron Cohen (49) are one of the cutest British couples. They have been married for 10 years now. But they have been together longer than that. Sacha met Isla in 2002 at a party in Australia. They officially got engaged in 2004 and finally, they sealed the deal in 2010 with a Jewish wedding. Together they have 3 beautiful children: two daughters and a son. </span>\r\n<h2><b>5.

But it’s true. They have been together for 9 years now. Many people think that they are married. But they are not actually. They have two daughters together. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ryan and Eva are very private persons. They hardly share their personal lives with the media which is a wise decision. Because look what happened to Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder. Johnny and Winona were the most adorable couple in the 90s. But their relationship was very public which was a major factor for their break up.</span>\r\n<h2><b>4. Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones</b></h2>\r\n<b>Movies Together: Traffic (IMDb Rating: 7.6)</b>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5363 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-4.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones Hollywood romantic couples\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, this one of the Oscar-winning most romantic couples of Hollywood. Michael Douglas was previously married to a film producer Diandra Luker, which was a 23-year-long marriage. But when he and Catherine met in 1998, they immediately felt a spark between them. Michael ended his 23-year-old marriage to be with Catherine, and they got married in 2000 and have been together since then.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Douglas (76) and Catherine Zeta-Jones (51) have a 25-year gap between them. But, hey! Nothing can stand between in love, right?</span>\r\n<h2><b>3. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson</b></h2>\r\n<b>Movies Together: Sleepless in Seattle (IMDb Rating: 6.8)</b>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5364 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-4.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks and Rita WilsonHollywood romantic couples\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 32-year-long happy marriage and still going on. Tom Hanks always believed in true love and a woman with whom he will grow old together. But his first marriage did not end well. But then in the same year, he got married to Rita Wilson, and the rest is just a wonderful love story. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tom Hanks (64) and Rita Wilson (64) met in 1981. Hanks was married to another woman then. But they reunited in 1988. Now, they have two sons and very happy marriage.</span>\r\n<h2><b>2. Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn</b></h2>\r\n<b>Movies Together: The Christmas Chronicles (IMDb Rating: 7.0)</b>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5365 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-3.jpg\" alt=\"Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kurt Russell (69) and Goldie Hawn (73) have been together for 37 years now.

They never got married though. But that never stopped Kurt and Goldie to be one of the most successful couples ever.</span>\r\n<h2><b>1. Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz</b></h2>\r\n<b>Movies Together: Dream House (IMDb Rating: 6.0)</b>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5366 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-3.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Craig (52) and Rachel Weisz (50) are a power couple. They fit together like nobody else.

So let’s have a look at the best actress nominees of the 78th Golden Globe Awards.  </span>\r\n<h2><b>5. Andra Day</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5428 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-Golden-Globe-Awards-Nominees-Best-Performance-by-an-Actress-1.jpg\" alt=\"Andra Day 2021 Golden Globe Awards Nominees Best Performance by an Actress (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Nominated For: </b><strong>The United States vs. Billie Holiday</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People generally know Andra Day for her singing career, at least that’s what her IMDb profile says. Andra has already participated in some feature films, both animation, and live-action. But </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States vs. Billie Holiday</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the first movie where she played a major role. It is a biography movie focusing on the life and career of </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billie Holiday</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A real singer playing roles in another singer’s biopic, we see movies of this sort quite often. </span> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jennifer Lopez</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selena Quintanilla</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selena</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyoncé</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Etta James</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cadillac Records</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamie Foxx</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ray</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Charles in Ray, etc. Jamie Foxx ever won an Oscar for best performance in a leading role for Ray. So, Andra Day is not too behind from her Golden Globe win either.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States vs. Billie Holiday can be considered a remake of Lady Sings the Blues (1972) where Diana Ross played the role of Billie Holiday.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USi-ppCfxEA[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4.

In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promising Young Woman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Carey plays a total badass Femme Fatale which people considered to be way out of her league. Dennis Harvey, a critic of the magazine </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Variety</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stated in his review that Margot Robbie would’ve been a better choice than Carey Mulligan, because, yes, Margot does look more badass than Carey at a glance. But Carey overcame what was laying on her way to achieving perfection for the role and she succeeded. And because of that, she has been rewarded with a Golden Globe Awards Nomination for Best Actress.</span>\r\n<h3>Watch Trailer:</h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i5kiFDunk8[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3.

Her versatile acting skill has been acknowledged by both critics and general people. A desperate mother, a police chief, a jobless lonely woman— Frances McDormand played many diverse characters in her career. She is a true color-changing artist. And this year she earned a Golden Globe Nominations for Best Actress 2021 which will be her 7th time. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Facts:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She is married to one of the Coen brothers, Joel Coen.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She is an adopted child.

An incident of a home-birth to a dead daughter throws everything off balance. Vanessa Kirby, with her beauty and grace pulled off her character so flawlessly that the movie will bring you into tears.

She makes the most unknown character relatable to us by her outstanding and incomparable acting skill. In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ma Rainey\'s Black Bottom,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she plays the R&amp;B mother Ma Rainey when the world was strictly biased by racism and sexism, which I think she has found very relatable to this day as a woman of color rising to her apex of success. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Oscar-winning actress has five previous Golden Globe Nominations and one win. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A/n: Now that I am talking about Viola Davis, you should go see the video where Viola Davis was the presenter of Meryl Streep’s Cecil B.

It was 2011 when the actor grabbed his first Hindi film, Dear Friend Hitler.

It is the twenty-first century and still, women have to work twice as hard to prove their worth. That is why female directors in the movie industry are as rare as a four-leaf clover. And a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">good</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> female director is even rarer.</span>\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Oscars, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The most prestigious film awards ever existed, had only 5 female directors to ever get a nomination in the category of <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/golden-globe-nominations-for-best-director-2021/\">Best Director</a> in the last 92 years. So <em><strong>this Women’s Day, let’s know and celebrate some of the best female directors of all time and the movies directed by them. </strong></em></span><em><strong> </strong></em>\r\n<h2><b>10. American Psycho (2000)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 7.6</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Harron\">Mary Harron</a></li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Christian Bale, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform</strong>: Amazon Prime Video, Hulu</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5493 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1.jpg\" alt=\"American Psycho (2000)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">American Psycho is a psychological thriller. It is about the narcissist central character, who becomes so blind with jealousy that he turns into a serial killer. This movie is <strong>based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis</strong>. The book is way gorier, to be honest.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">American Psycho is the first highlight of Christian Bale’s career. Many people told him not to do the movie. But their forbidding made him want to do the movie more.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mary Harron has mainly directed TV series episodes and American Psycho is sadly her only well-known film.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81mibtQWWBg[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Fun Facts:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reese Witherspoon was three months pregnant when she was working on this film.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leonardo DiCaprio was offered the role of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Patrick Bateman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. He turned down the offer for several reasons. </span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is a TV series spin-off of this movie where Mila Kunis played the main lead. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<em><b>Personal recommendation: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you like this movie, you should watch <strong>The Machinist (2004)</strong> and<strong> Identity (2003). </strong></span></em>\r\n<h2><b>9. Winter’s Bone (2010)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 7.1</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: Debra Granik (Also Directed Leave No Trace)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Jennifer Lawrence, John Hawkes</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform</strong>: Kanopy, DIRECTV</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5494 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2.jpg\" alt=\"Winter’s Bone (2010)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Winter’s Bone portrays the struggle of a young girl to support her mentally ill mother and two younger siblings. She has a missing father, whose presence causes more trouble than his absence. Ree Dolly must now find her father to save her house and prevent her family from being thrown into the forest.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong> was turned down for her role showing cause that she was too pretty for the job. But her tenacity won her the role and with amazing acting skills and flawless Ozark accent, she won the heart of everybody else.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are only 6 directorial credits in Debra Granik’s career. Winter’s Bone was her third film. <em><strong>She was nominated for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) for this movie</strong></em></span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE_X2pDRXyY[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Awards and Nominations:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This movie was nominated for four Oscars.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is one of the <strong>lowest-grossing movies</strong> to be nominated for the best picture at the Oscars.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jennifer Lawrence was only 19</strong> when she worked in this movie. She also got her first best actress Oscar nomination for this film. She was only 20 then which makes her one of the youngest best actress nominees in Oscar history. </span><b>   </b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>8. Monster (2003)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 7.3</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: Patty Jenkins (Also Directed, Wonder Woman, Wonder Woman 1984)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast</strong>: Charlize Theron, Christina Ricci</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform</strong>: Tubi TV, Hoopla</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5495 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.jpg\" alt=\"Monster (2003)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is the <strong>biopic of Aileen Wuornos, a female prostitute with a horrific childhood</strong>, who was raped and sexually abused countless times. A woman whom reality made a murderer. Charlize Theron’s performance in the character of Aileen Wuornos was awe-worthy. Maybe that’s because Charlize herself was a victim of child abuse growing up as well. Her mother had to shoot her father to death to protect Charlize and herself. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">People say women are women’s worst enemies. But it is also only a woman who can understand another woman so perfectly. Maybe that’s why together director <strong>Patty Jenkins </strong>and <strong>actress Charlize Theron</strong> could make it possible to turn the life of America’s first woman serial killer into an amazing feature film.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maybe as women, they understood better than anyone else what made Aileen Wuornos snap and why she started to kill people.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq70brIQP40[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Awards and Nominations:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Monster had one Oscar win.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The only Oscar nomination and win, which Charlize Theron received in the category of best actress in a leading role, took place on Aileen Wuornos’s birthday.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2><b>7. Little Women (2019)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 7.8</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: Greta Gerwig (Also Directed Lady Bird)</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet, Laura Dern, Meryl Streep</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform</strong>: Starz, DIRECTV</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5496 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4.jpg\" alt=\"Little Women (2019)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The time set up is after the Civil War, there were four sisters who had their own individual stories to tell, but their stories are also what made them wholesome.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Greta Gerwig has been working as an actress long before she started her directing career. Little Women is her second movie which was nominated for multiple Oscars. Her previous movie <em><strong>Lady Bird</strong></em> was also based on a plot featuring a young woman trying to live an individual life without anyone else’s influence or impact.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Greta Gerwig has only directed 3 movies and except for her directorial debut, <strong>the other two were very successful.</strong> We wish she will have a long and progressive career ahead of her and become one of the best female directors in Hollywood.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AST2-4db4ic[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Awards and Nominations:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This movie has a total of 6 Oscar nominations and one win, which is in the category of Best Achievement in Costume Design.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Fun Fact:</b></h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Greta Gerwig is the 12th woman to direct a Best Picture Oscar-nominated film.</span></li>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2018, Greta Gerwig was <strong>nominated for the best director at the Oscars</strong>, but she lost it to Guillermo del Toro (The Shape of Water).</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2><b>6. Boys Don’t Cry (1999)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><strong>IMDb Rating:</strong> 7.5</li>\r\n <li><strong>Director</strong>: Kimberly Peirce</li>\r\n <li><strong>Star Cast:</strong> Hilary Swank, Chloë Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard</li>\r\n <li><strong>Platform</strong>: Vudu</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5497 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5.jpg\" alt=\"Boys Don’t Cry (1999)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Brandon Teena was Teena Brandon once. After going through sex-change surgery she became a he and fell in love with a woman. But getting used to a new body is not easy, especially when society is completely against you. This is a story about adapting to a new life, a man born in the wrong body. <strong>It is based on a true actual event,</strong> the time set in the late 20th century when society was more biased and prejudiced than now.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With <strong>18 directorial credits</strong>, it is sad to say, Boys Don’t Cry is the only highlight in Kimberly Peirce’s career. It was also her first feature film. Some other movies she gave directions are Stop-Loss, Carrie.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpUhVvfGeg[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Awards and Nominations:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This movie was <strong>nominated for 2 Oscars</strong>.

But now he has turned himself into a great capable actor who is not bound by any nationality or religion anymore. Yes, I am talking about none other than <strong>Tahar Rahim</strong>. He was this year’s <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/golden-globe-awards-nominees-2021-best-motion-picture-drama/\"><strong>Golden Globe nominee</strong></a> in the category of <strong>best actor.</strong> And he, very well, could be a nominee in this year’s Oscar as well.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Early Life</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is hard to believe but Tahar Rahim’s first career choice was not acting. When he enrolled in college, his first choice was <strong>sports</strong> and his second choice was <strong>computer science</strong>. But after two years of boring study, Tahar came to realize that it was not for him. He, then, got admitted to <a href=\"https://www.univ-montp3.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Paul Valéry University</strong></a>. There he studied film and drama. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before his first breakthrough, Tahar worked on two movies and one popular French TV series. His character did not even have any names in his first two movies. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movies are </span><strong><i>The 9/11 Commission Report (2006) </i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><strong><i>Inside (2007)</i>.</strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had a name on the TV series though.

Today let’s get to know about it a little more.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Early life</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gagroo’s hometown had been the capital city of <strong>Delhi</strong> where she was born and brought up. For attaining school education, she went to a reputed educational institution there. The actress inclined acting and other such performing arts from the very beginning. In fact, she is trained in two of the difficult dance forms, <strong>Kathak</strong>, and <strong>Jazz</strong>, and can outshine many in this field.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Maanvi started her acting career in 2007, she soon returned to her hometown, mainly because of getting typecast. Returning to Delhi the actress wanted to complete her higher education and hence took admission in the well-known College of the <strong>Delhi University</strong>, <strong>Gargi College.</strong> It was the year 2010 when she finally graduated with a <strong>bachelor’s degree</strong> in the subject of <strong>psychology</strong>.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Maanvi Gagroo Instagram : <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maanvigagroo/?hl=en\">@maanvigagroo </a></b>Followers : 490K</h3>\r\n<h2><b>Maanvi Gagroo age and physique</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5602 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maanvi-Gagroo-biography-2.jpg\" alt=\"Maanvi Gagroo physique\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1985 born Gagroo is currently about<strong> 35-years-old.</strong> Unlike other Indian actresses, she has not made the terms zero figure and beauty synonymous for herself.

Her debut was with a famous musical drama that aired on the Disney Channel, </span><strong><i>Dhoom Machado Dhoom</i>.</strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a total of <strong>100 episodes,</strong> the soap opera beautifully narrated the story of 4 teens, more specifically 4 school-going young passionate musicians and their journey to form a band. Gagroo was seen in the character of one of the four leads, Bikki gill, an overexcited friendly Punjabi girl who used to play a musical instrument called the tambourine.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>See Gagroo in a scene from her first TV show</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5JmrHKAkJw[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>The career in theatre</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we mentioned in a previous section about how Manvi returned to Delhi post her first TV show, it was after graduating she realized how much she has been passionate about acting and thus again she <strong>shifted to Mumbai.</strong> Again before beginning with TV and movies she wanted to act on stage and hence joined a theatre group. During that time, she gave many admirable onstage performances in plays.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>Works on the big screen – Maanvi Gagroo movies</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the very beginning of her career, the actress starred in a small role in Disney\'s original, </span><strong><i>The Cheetah Girls: One World</i>.</strong>\r\n<h3><strong>Maanvi in 2009:</strong></h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5609 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maanvi-Gagroo-biography-9.jpg\" alt=\"Smoking\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2009 we saw her in the adorable buddy drama, </span><strong><i>Aamras The Sweet Taste of Friendship</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>.</strong> This movie which narrated the tale of 4 friends, their tales of friendships and loves did not achieve much popularity, but Maanvi’s performance in one of the lead roles definitely stole our attention.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>2011:</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2011 she was seen in the Rani Mukherjee-Vidya Balan starrer biographical thriller, </span><strong><i>No one Killed Jessica</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

400;\">When was the last time you went to a cinema hall to watch a <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/hollywoods-top-10-feel-good-movies-you-must-watch/\">good movie</a> which was totally worth the money and spent quality time with your friends and family? If you didn\'t go to watch Christopher Nolan\'s <em><strong>Tenet</strong></em>, then I guess it\'s been a year if I am not wrong.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let me ask you when was the last time you watched a good movie or binge-watched a web series on a platform like <strong><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/16-best-bollywood-movies-of-2020-on-netflix-and-amazon-prime/\">Netflix</a>, Disney + Hotstar, Amazon Prime, </strong>or <strong>Zee 5</strong>? Today? Yesterday? Last week maybe? </span>\r\n<h2><b>The rise of OTTs</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year 2020 has been a hell ride but one thing that gained its peak in this mostly digital/ online year is OTT platforms. By this time Indians aren\'t really alien to this term as they were almost 5 years back when entertainment was synonymous with TV and movie theatres. </span>\r\n<h2><b>The shows that increased the demand for digital content</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5629 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Actor-competition-in-2021-2.jpg\" alt=\"Actor competition in 2021  (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although these OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime video has already entered the scene, it saw a major boom in its viewership in 2018 with the release of mainly two web series, namely </span><strong><i>Sacred Games </i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Saif Ali Khan on Netflix and </span><strong><i>Mirzapur</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starring Ali Fazal, Pankaj Tripathi on Amazon Prime Video. Since then, the OTT business set its sail and never turned back. </span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSijFjsMKM[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<strong><em>(watch this best compilation of Ganesh Gaitonde moments from Sacred Games and witness Nawaz’s lifelike acting)</em></strong>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUIcp8dRvcI[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<strong><em>(watch these scenes from Mirzapur)</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5632 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Actor-competition-in-2021-5.jpg\" alt=\"Actor competition in 2021  (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OTT platforms began curating and producing mainly content-driven shows. On the other hand, I don\'t think you will be surprised if I say that the Bollywood industry is mostly star cast driven rather than content. Where star-driven Bollywood keeps on increasing the list of 100 crore club movies, we have seen the OTT platforms bagging Emmy Nominations with shows like</span><strong><i> Made in Heaven </i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on Amazon Prime video and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Delhi Crime</strong> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on Netflix.  </span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfnWRfnzta0[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<strong><em>(watch these scenes from Made in Heaven)</em></strong>\r\n<h2><b>The sudden pandemic and its impact</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5630 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Actor-competition-in-2021-3.jpg\" alt=\"Actor competition in 2021  (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although people were enjoying both of these contents side by side, the year 2020 was kind of a game-changer in this duel. With the sudden Covid-19 pandemic and closing of the movie theatres and multiplexes, the star-driven Bollywood has faced a major setback. Big projects like Rohit Shetty\'s and Karan Johar\'s got postponed and we saw the rise of OTT platforms.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prominent filmmakers like <strong>Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Shoojit Sircar, Hansal Mehta</strong>, etc. jumped into the scene now not with bankable glamorous faces but with versatile and promising actors, some new and others who had already claimed a share in the rise of OTT platforms. </span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoytihkwgXM[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<strong><em> (If you missed this promising horror Netflix release Bulbul in 2020 starring an underrated actress like Tripi Damri, you really m9ssed something great)</em></strong>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5molN55chcg[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<strong><em> (Also don’t miss out on this Amazon Prime show-stealer from 2020, Bandish Bandits)</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the cinema halls are reopening and have started with their new charm and OTT platforms are launching back-to-back promising shows and movies, which will claim fame in 2021? The Actors or the Stars? Here I would like to focus on a few factors which might be helpful in further understanding this debate.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Content</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the last two-three years, the various OTT platforms are bent on providing the viewers with all types of content you can think of spanning across all genres from documentaries, comedy, thriller, erotica, family drama and whatnot. This range is not only seen in the genres but from various languages all across the globe and for a country like ours, all across the country.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently a few weeks ago, Netflix brought out a list of all the upcoming movies and web series that they are going to release this year. Well, that list is enough for one to digest the fact that I am talking about. And the best part, you can enjoy all these in the comforts of your home.  </span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx0_LOzWkJk[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<strong><em> (see what Netflix has in store for you in 2021)</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No high-pitched dialogues, melodious songs, or such item dances and romance, but soon these OTTs grew addictive. Tell me the last time you came across people talking about larger-than-life actors and their mainstream films?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, I guess it\'s when people were talking about how Akshay Kumar starred Laxmi was equally disliked by the audience and slammed by the critics at the same time. Somehow, somewhere the glamour of the mainstream industry doesn\'t quite fit well in the OTT platforms. </span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_UMVPOBZjk[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<strong><em> (watch how a famous YouTube channel bashed Laxmi during giving its review)</em> </strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People are surely changing their tastes but will the Khans, Kapoors, and Chopra\'s will be so easily forgotten?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Somewhere deep inside you know that charm still exists and when talking about spending a good family time during Diwali or Eid, watching a good crime drama with curse words being uttered every 5 mins doesn\'t really add up.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Cost </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is it like to watch a big production house project starring the <strong>Khans, Kapoors,</strong> and<strong> the Chopras</strong> in air-conditioned halls with cushiony seats and an amazing sound system? Really amazing right? But you know it comes with a hole in your pocket and on weekends, it\'s even more. It\'s quite an experience. But do all movies that get released require such an ambience?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>I don\'t think so.</strong> There are shows that you look to binge-watch during your weekends while biting a snack, sitting at the corner of your bed. There come to the OTT platforms to play. As the internet is getting cheaper day by day, so are the OTT platforms are coming up with cheaper and pocket-friendly plans. These plans are surprisingly cheaper than what you need to pay for a single movie ticket to watch a 2 hr show in a multiplex whereas you get hundreds of curated shows on these online platforms at even cheaper prices. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you also now think twice before visiting a movie theatre</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although cinema halls have opened up with proper sanitization and maintenance of social distance, and movies are being released every week, there\'s somehow still doubt when you question yourself when planning a day out to the multiplexes.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life may be short, but we can forever find comfort in the soothing image of SRK\'s widespread arms, Salman\'s Bhai-Giri, Aamir\'s charming humour, and that feeling to find ourselves. Stars are a source of joy, beauty, and pleasure and our obsession and relationship with these stars totally remain unapologetic!</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAM5yeYYxuE[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<strong><em> (Let’s once again be a little nostalgic by seeing the iconic ‘spreading arm’ romantic gesture of King Khan)</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So as the clash between the stars and the actors has started, we are yet to see whether the charm and glamour or the content wins. Will the amazing <strong><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/pankaj-tripathi-biography-movies-tv-and-awards/\">Pankaj Tripathi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/shweta-tripathi-biography-tv-shows-movies-and-commercial-ads/\">Shweta Tripathi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/jitendra-kumar-life-biography-and-bollywood-journey/\">Jitendra Kumar</a></strong> or <strong>Criminal Justice, Kota Factory, Pataal Lok, Lootcase, Ludo,</strong> or <strong>Sir</strong> be able to match the glam and fame of mighty Khans and Kapoors or the to-die-for actors like Deepika, Kareena, and Katrina?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will content defeat glamour? And will realism defeat escapism? Will actors challenge stars?</span>\r\n\r\nThe game is on!\r\nThis is the content for today. Hope you had a happy reading.

From the boy next door to a favourite face of web shows and Hindi movies, the journey has not been really free from struggles.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Early life - Who is Ali Fazal</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ali spent his early life in the state of Uttar Pradesh. His birth was in the capital city of </span><b>Lucknow</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, the actor did not have a very peaceful childhood due to the not-so-good relationship with his parents who got divorced when he was an 18-year-old boy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Firstly, Fazal’s schooling was from</span><b> La Martinere college </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">situated in Lucknow. But soon after, he shifted to his next alma meter, the well-known </span><b>boarding school of Dehradun</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Doon School. It was during those days when his passion for acting developed and reportedly he participated in many school plays, delivering admirable performances. Apart from this, the multi-talented Ali had also been a pro in basketball and dreamed of outshining in this field too.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After completing schooling from Dehradun, Fazal shifted to </span><b>Mumbai </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to pursue his higher studies. He got himself admitted to St. Xavier’s college from where he pursued graduation and obtained a </span><b>bachelors’ degree in economics</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, his college days were not as enjoyable as that of us and at the age of 19, he had to take up a job at a call center just to pay his college fee. It used to pay him only </span><b>Rs. 8000 a month</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Last year, Ali tweeted about this which increased our love and respect for him a little more.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Other basic information – Ali Fazal age and physique</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1986 born Ali is currently almost</span><b> 35 years.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With a height of about</span><b> 5’10”</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and well-maintained body measurements, he has the perfect body of an actor that fits perfectly with his charming yet cute face.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Ali Fazal friends and family</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned before, Fazal didn’t grow up in a very happy family. In fact, his childhood had been spent with his grandparents at their house since this mom and dad separated at the time when he was a child. Much is not known about his parents but his father didn\'t live in India and worked in the Middle East. Last year in 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic Ali’s mother passed away because of some health issues.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5637 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ali-Fazal-biography-and-other-interesting-facts-2.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Fazal father\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>(With His father)</strong></em></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5638 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ali-Fazal-biography-and-other-interesting-facts-3.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Fazal mother\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>(With His mother)</strong></em></p>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding his friendships, it is known to many that during the shoots of his film Victoria and Abdul, the actor had developed a very sweet and affectionate bond of friendship with his senior co-actress, the legendary Judi Dench.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has a very friendly nature and is friends with people from various backgrounds; at least this can be deduced from Ali Fazal Instagram.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5641 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ali-Fazal-biography-and-other-interesting-facts-6.jpg\" alt=\"ali fazal friends\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5642 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ali-Fazal-biography-and-other-interesting-facts-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5643 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ali-Fazal-biography-and-other-interesting-facts-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><strong>New beginnings with Theatre</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his school and college days, the actor had very actively engaged himself in Theatre. It was one of such on-stage performances that grabbed attention and made him make his way to Bollywood. In fact, during his college days, he was a part of a play adapted from </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest\"><b>William Shakespeare’s novel, </b><b><i>The Tempest</i></b><b>.</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Later the actor said that it was this play that finally urged him to take up acting as a full-time career. He had also been part of the famous Prithvi Theatres for some time.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>A small screen start – Ali Fazal TV shows</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not any regular Hindi soap opera; in fact, Fazal at the very beginning of his career got the chance to act in a famous American TV miniseries, </span><b><i>Bollywood Hero</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In 2009, the series aired on the famous American TV channel, IFC. We saw him in the character of an Indian director, </span><b>Monty Kapoor.</b>\r\n<h2><strong>The journey in Bollywood – Ali Fazal movies</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It was the year 2008 when Ali Fazal started his journey with Hindi movies. His debut had been with a cameo role in the Indian American romcom, </span><b><i>The Other End Of The Line</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, it failed to create magic in the box office as well as with the audiences and did not give Fazal much recognition.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2009, he finally got the chance to be the lead of a Bollywood movie. It was an erotic thriller, </span><b><i>Ek Tho Chance</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where we saw the talented actor sharing screen space with other eminent Bollywood personalities like </span><b>Amrita Rao</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><b>Saurabh Shukla</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Though it was basically his proper Bollywood debut and was premiered in a Film Festival in 2009 itself, it reached audiences in the year 2014 when it got released in theatres.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same year, 2009 Ali first gave his first breakthrough performance in the iconic Raj Kumar Hirani-directed blockbuster comedy film, </span><b><i>3 Idiots</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Though he was cast in a cameo role, he had been highly noticed and received praises from the audiences.</span>\r\n<h3><strong> Watch Fazal’s scene from 3 idiots</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being an outsider, Ali didn’t have a very smooth career and faced numerous ups and downs to reach the stardom he has today. His next film was released in 2011. It has been the gradually forgettable and box office flop film </span><b><i>Always Kabhi Kabhi</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With negative reviews and backlashes from the audience Fazal could have stepped backwards and given up on his Bollywood career but he didn’t do so and then the turning point of his journey came in 2013.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <strong>Watch a young Fazal in this scene from Always Kabhi Kabhi</strong></span></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RikmHFgvkBY[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2013, he successfully gave his first hit </span><b><i>Fukrey</i></b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which had been both a commercial as well as a critical success. Even today, several years later, this comedy film is still a favourite among the masses, especially among the youths. It gained so much popularity that in 2017 its sequel </span><b><i>Fukrey Returns</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was made and it was equally loved by the audiences.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Watch Fazal in this promo from Fukrey</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HnIMU3kV-w[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that Ali did not have to look back and appeared in a number of films in lead as well as supporting roles. It is not that all of those films worked and all of his performances had received appreciations; but of course, the talent and potential he has as an artist cannot be at all denied today. Till 2021 he appeared in a number of firms including </span><i>Bobby Jasoos, Sonali Cable Khamoshiya, Happy Bhaag Jaigi, Happy Phir Bhag Jagi, Milan Talkies, Prasshthanaam, House Arrest.</i>\r\n<h3><strong>Watch Fazal in this Sonali cable scene</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW_WRWpz0cI[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong>Brief but significant appearances in Hollywood too!</strong></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5639 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ali-Fazal-biography-and-other-interesting-facts-4.jpg\" alt=\"ali fazal hollywood\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those rare Indian actors, who behind leaving a mark in Bollywood by their extraordinary talent had also started working in the Hollywood industry is none other than this </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fukrey</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> actor.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5640 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ali-Fazal-biography-and-other-interesting-facts-5.jpg\" alt=\"ali fazal hollywood1\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2015, he started to work in Hollywood with a cameo role in </span><b><i>Fast and Furious 7</i></b><b>.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Though it is a cameo role and he had a very brief screen presence, the way Ali portrayed it always leaves a significant impact on the viewers.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Fazal’s scene from First and Furious 7</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGh1wFYQUWk[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then he was cast in another British film named </span><b><i>Victoria and Abdul</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where he was seen as the male lead.

In 2015, he had been a part of the India TV and Fortis campaign. And he involved himself in spreading awareness about cancer. Later he also took part in a musical concert in order to gather funds for the sufferers of the devastating 2015 earthquake of Nepal that destroyed numerous lives.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>Achievements</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All through his career, Ali got lots of love and appreciation for his really praiseworthy works.

A historical achievement it has been for the film as it received the Oscars. While accepting the <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/golden-globe-nominations-for-best-director-2021/\"><strong>Golden Globe Awards in 2020</strong>,</a> director Bong Jong exclaimed how by overcoming just the barrier of subtitles or by being habitual in seeing the subtitles along with a movie, one can see some really amazing works of the world.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Till now only 11 international films have been nominated for the best picture in Oscars. Each of them is best and unique and deserves at least once a lifetime watch.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you come out a bit of your comfort zone and start getting deeper into works of cinema beyond the confinements of Bollywood and Hollywood, you will know that how apt has been Bong Jong Hoo\'s remark. All credits go to the various online streaming platforms which makes these cinematic gems available to us. I am no critic, but we here at TVFreak will try to provide a to-watch guide to explore these international gems.</span>\r\n<h2><b>1. Parasite (2020) | Foreign Language Films</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Country: </b>South Korea</li>\r\n <li><b>Language: </b>Korean</li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 8.6</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on:</b> Amazon Prime Video</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5648 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-foreign-films-to-watch-right-now-2.jpg\" alt=\"Parasite (2020): 10 foreign films to watch right now (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the story of how the struggling Kim family sees an opportunity when the son starts working for the wealthy Park family. Soon, all of them find a way to work within the same household and start living a parasitic life.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This<strong> Korean movie</strong> Parasite has given Bong more global prominence than his English-language wannabe blockbusters like Snowpiercer making him stand out as one of the greatest directors of his time. From an anti-capitalist theme to everything that <strong>Bong Jong Hoo</strong> tries to project is worth watching and primitively thought-provoking. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From social class division and climate change to exquisitely designed sets, and watching the ease with which a casual hangout scene mutates, first into a pressurized suspense set-piece and then into horror, and realize you’re in the company of a master filmmaker. His other works such as Memories to Murder, Okja, and Mother will prove how great a director he is.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEUXfv87Wpk[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>2. Roma (2018)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Country: </b>Mexico</li>\r\n <li><b>Language: </b>Spanish</li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 7.7</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available: </b>on Netflix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5649 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-foreign-films-to-watch-right-now-3.jpg\" alt=\"Roma (2018): 10 foreign films to watch right now (3)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Roma\'\' shares its name with a neighbourhood in <strong>Mexico City</strong> where families live behind locked gates, and where maids, cooks, and drivers busily keep homes running. Set in the 1970s,<strong> it\'s about a maid</strong> who works in a middle-class white family which is somehow falling apart. Although this backdrop might sound small to some, Alfonso Cuaron uses a large canvas to paint this picture in a black and white tone.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have seen Cuaron\'s other works like Children of Men and Gravity, you\'ll know that Roma\'s cinematographic excellence is not new but definitely, the panoramic style further enhances the depth of these <strong>\"larger than life\"</strong> characters.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie has <strong>won three Oscars</strong> for best cinematography, for foreign-language films, and the best director.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is an <strong>intimate, expansive, </strong>and<strong> emotional</strong> portrait of life and definitely a true masterpiece.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIClGSY5_tY[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3. Amélie (2001) | Foreign Language Films</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Country: </b>France</li>\r\n <li><b>Language: </b>French</li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 8.3</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on: </b>HBO Max</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5650 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-foreign-films-to-watch-right-now-4.jpg\" alt=\"Amélie (2001): 10 foreign films to watch right now (4)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the story of Amélie is an <strong>innocent, introverted, </strong>and<strong> naive girl</strong> in Paris with her own sense of justice. She decides to help those around her and at times mischievous but makes sure to smile on our faces and, along the way, discovers love. So many intricate themes at play, it\'s wrong to call it just a rom-com.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The colours and visuals of this film are also very whimsical. We see paintings and photographs talking to the characters, telling them what they should do. We see green, red, and yellow-themed interiors and atmospheres throughout the film, which gives it a very warm feeling. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Amélie is one of those once in a decade comedy which shatters its charms like the pearls from a broken necklace, all more adorable because they are not real,\" wrote Times critic Barbara Ellen</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUECWi5pX7o[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>4.

Director Guillermo del Toro is well-known for his ability to combine the fantasy world with our ordinary lives maintaining a thin line that separates the two. Though dark, it is considered a cinematic masterpiece, is supposed to be the best example of his work.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ARCBVIE_KQ[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>5. Incendies (2010)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Country: </b>Canada</li>\r\n <li><b>Language: </b>French</li>\r\n <li><b>IMDb 8.3</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on:</b> Amazon Prime Video</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5652 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-foreign-films-to-watch-right-now-6.jpg\" alt=\"Incendies (2010): 10 foreign films to watch right now (6)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a mystery &amp; sci-fi movie bug, you are pretty much well accustomed to the works of the filmmaker Denis Villeneuve who has made some of the most visually stunning movies like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 with a lurking theme of morality wrapped with mystery. Although this 2010 project is no sci-fi but based on the same theme. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From its arresting opening to its shattering conclusion, the Canadian film Incendies is violent yet emotional film-making of the true sense with a captivating technical fineness, self-confidence without judging the characters. This movie is based on the stage play by Wajdi Mouawad which revolves around Nawal, a dying woman from Lebanon, living in Montreal who leaves separate letters to her twin children Jeanne and Simon to be read after she dies.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Jeanne is to deliver hers to the father who they thought was dead, and Simon is to give his to the brother about whom they never knew. The siblings travel to their mother\'s homeland, where they each experience acts of violence, come to know family history and have revelations about themselves.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ69WnwvZhE[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>6.

The movie starts at a slow pace like any other Asghar Farhadi movie and then slowly picks up the pace and unstoppably races to the finish breaking you down into tiny little bits.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Onuy5USTc[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>7. City of God (2002)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Country: </b>Brazil</li>\r\n <li><b>Language: </b>Portuguese</li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 8.6</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on:</b> <a href=\"https://www.primevideo.com/?ref_=dvm_pds_amz_in_as_s_g_72|m_fQQR2NKbc_c386629063601\">Amazon Prime Video</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5654 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-foreign-films-to-watch-right-now-8.jpg\" alt=\"City of God (2002)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the real-life story, the movie is about two boys who are brought up in a violent neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro. They adopt diverse professional paths, with one of them becoming a photographer and the other boy becoming a drug dealer.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is beautifully narrated and presented in chapters. Initial chapters focus on the character build-up of every main character, the middle ones are based on the massive drug empire and how it affects the personal lives of each character, and the last ones include typical gang rivalry and the rise of the narrator of the movie as a daring &amp; successful photographer. Shot mostly in a documentary style it\'s one of the best in its genre and it\'s just a delight to watch.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcUOO4Itgmw[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>8.

Vibrant colours and the background score fit the movie perfectly also exploring the voidness experienced by the characters. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, watch In The Mood for Love by Wong Kar Wai.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bjd7PFf_TFw[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>9.

What at first look seems to be the story of an extended working-class poor family struggling to make ends meet with love and affection. Later it reveals the unlikely origins of how those people all ended up together. With clear-eyed compassion, the movie looks at human need, the law, murder, child abuse, and sex work. </span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwcb5ki1f-4[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>10.

The story which is so different from the modern-day films about queer love shows how progressive is the Bengali Films Industry and truly deserves the National Award.</span>\r\n<h2><b> Village Rockstars ( 2017)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Language: Assamese</b></li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 7.6</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on Netflix</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6580 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Best-Regionalmovie-1.jpg\" alt=\"Village Rockstars ( 2017)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This critically acclaimed and award-winning Assamese movie was India\'s official entry into the 91st Academy Awards. But, unfortunately, it didn\'t make it to the final nominations. With a backdrop of a small village of Chaygaon in Assam, it is the story of a ten-year-old girl Dhunu who wishes to own a guitar and make her own rock band despite the fact that she belongs to a very poor family where getting a square meal a day is quite a deal.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dhunu saves money to fulfill her wish but due to her financial and social constraints and crisis she has to set her priorities and forego her dream. Director Rima Das has single-handedly shown the life of real rural Assam and the hardships they face.</span>\r\n<h2><b> Super Deluxe ( 2019)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Language: Malayalam</b></li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 8.3</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on Netflix</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6581 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Best-Regionalmovie-2.jpg\" alt=\"Super Deluxe ( 2019)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Malayalee movie directed by Thiagarajan Kumararaja is an anthology thriller with four subplots all connected together at the end. What they have in common is the fact that they have committed a sin as perceived by society.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With vivid colors, still, camera shots, wonderful casting including Fahaad Faasil and Vijay Setupathi the movie reflects a society with an amalgamation of subtle humor. Vijay Setupathi\'s role as a transwoman is something that will blow your mind! As you start watching the movie, it will take no time for you to get engrossed in the characters and empathize with them.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Xq_Zz3nPA[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b> Aamis ( 2019)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Language: Assamese</b></li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 8</b></li>\r\n <li><b>( Currently unavailable in any major streaming platform)</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6582 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Best-Regionalmovie-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another Assamese film that deserves to be on this list is Bhaskar Hazarika\'s Aamis. The title means meat eater. This is one of those unique love stories you will encounter which is really dark and sensuous. It revolves around the sensuous relationship between Nirmali, a married doctor, and Sumon, a Ph.D. scholar, all centered around their love for unusual meat.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filled with visual metaphors and psychedelic scenes and intense soundtrack, the movie dives deep into the human psyche with its art without letting us judge the characters.</span>\r\n<h2><b> Court (2014)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Language: Marathi</b></li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB 7.7</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on Netflix</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6583 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Best-Regionalmovie-4.jpg\" alt=\"Court (2014)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chaitanya Tamhane\'s directorial debut is about a Dalit musician and teacher named Narayan Kamble who has been falsely accused as a sewer worker committed suicide after being inspired by his song.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Mumbai<a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/courtroom-movies-based-on-real-life-stories/\"> courtroom drama</a> starts at a slow pace with but as it proceeds, it slowly engulfs you with its screenplay. The movie will make you question the tyrannical system as it showcases the endless delays of justice one has to suffer in this system.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sc8z7zav9A[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b> \'96 (2018)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Language: Tamil</b></li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 8.6</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on YouTube, MX player, Jio cinema</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6584 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Best-Regionalmovie-5.jpg\" alt=\"\'96 (2018) movie\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C Prem Kumar\'s 96 is a warm story of two childhood friends Ram ( played by Vijay Setupathi) and Jaanu ( played by Trisha Krishnan). They parted from each other, led by their destiny. The two sweethearts meet after 22 years in the reunion of the batch of \'96 but still manages to spell their warmth and magic.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This melancholic tale is a tribute to unconditional love and taps into nostalgia to leave us with happy associations with our past and is definitely a delight to watch.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0synl-lI4I[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b> Angamaly Dairies (2017)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Language: Malayalam</b></li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 8</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on Netflix</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6585 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Best-Regionalmovie-6.jpg\" alt=\"Angamaly Dairies (2017)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, Lijo George Pellissery\'s one of the other gems is Angamaly Dairies which is about Vincent Pepe ( played by Anthony Varghese) who wants to be a powerful leader of a righteous gang in Angamaly.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With 86 new cast, this movie has received massive acclaim due to its strong portrayal of masculinity, action sequences, and small-town gang wars and even came to be known as Gangs of Wasseypur of the south. Lijo George Pellissery has gifted us with few exceptional cinematic gems like Ee Ma Yu and the most recent Jallikattu.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yRBJCrjabU[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b> Sairat (2016)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Language: Marathi</b></li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 8.3</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on YouTube</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6586 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Best-Regionalmovie-7.jpg\" alt=\"Sairat (2016)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nagraj Manjule\'s both critically acclaimed and commercially successful love story. It is a proper take on the caste discrimination existing in our society. When a low caste fisherman\'s son, Parshya falls in love with Archi, who happens to be the daughter of a wealthy businessman, they are opposed by society. And they have no other option than to elope and lead a new life in Hyderabad until an unexpected turn.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the movie has drama, songs, and dance but will leave you shattered by the end of the movie and will make you think</span>\r\n<h2><b> Baishe Shrabon (2011)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Language: Bengali</b></li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 8.1</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on Disney+Hotstar</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6587 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Best-Regionalmovie-8.jpg\" alt=\"Baishe Shrabon (2011)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An extremely compelling and thought-provoking film from West Bengal that is going to leave you complex is Shrijit Mukherjee\'s Bishe Shrabon.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It focuses on several murders in Kolkata where notes left at the crime scene is the written verse of Bengali poets and these come as clues for the police and how they come to the bottom of the case is what will transfix you. Even though the film is pitched loud, its integration of Bengali poetry and crime thriller will truly excite you.</span>\r\n<h2><b> Kumbalangi Nights (2019)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Language: Malayalam</b></li>\r\n <li><b>IMDB: 8.6</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Available on Amazon Prime Video</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6588 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Best-Regionalmovie-9.jpg\" alt=\"Kumbalangi Nights (2019)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, The story of four brothers and their character dynamics vividly portrays the beauty of Kerala and stunning cinematography embedded with a soulful soundtrack, based on the fishing hamlet of Kumbalangi. The first half of the movie is more character-driven. And the latter half is when the story starts unfolding and picks up its pace.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P4BFBSafF0[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, The tense and the surprising climax is dealt with in a comical tone.

Seems like the director did not pay heeds to comments like ‘flag bearer of nepotism or the entire debate of <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/nepotism-and-favouritism-in-bollywood-star-kids-vs-outsiders/\">nepotism</a> that has arisen surrounding him after the unfortunate demise of the </span><i style=\"font-weight: inherit;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chichhore</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> actor Sushant Singh Rajput.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>Who is this Shanaya Kapoor?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Shanaya hails from the famous <strong>Anil-Bonney Kapoor</strong> clan of the Hindi film industry. She is the daughter of <strong>Sanjay Kapoor</strong>, a talented and known face from the glamorous world of Bollywood. He had been a debutant of 1995 and is known for movies like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prem, Julie, Kartavya, Lust stories, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and so on. She is the nephew of Bollywood biggies like <strong>Boney Kapoor</strong> and <strong>Anil Kapoor</strong> while other famous faces such as <strong>Sonam Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor, Jahnhvi Kapoor</strong> are her <strong>first cousins</strong>.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5668 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Shanaya-Kapoor-4.jpg\" alt=\"Shanaya Kapoor karan johar nepotism\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have already seen her in the Recent Netflix reality TV series </span><strong><i>Fabulous lives Bollywood wives</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a sneak peak in the personal and professional lives of the better halves of Bollywood stars like Sanjay Kapoor and Chunky Pandey. Technically, it has not been her debut as it has been more of a documentary or reality kind of thing where we saw the real Shanaya Kapoor and not the actress aspect of her. She had been seen sharing the screen along with her mother Mandeep Sandhu. </span>\r\n<h2><b>The announcement</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5667 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Shanaya-Kapoor-3.jpg\" alt=\"Shanaya Kapoor karan johar\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, this pretty face is going to be launched in Bollywood. And this will be done by another of <strong>KJo’s Dharma film</strong> <strong>ventures</strong>, a debut of dreams that every aspiring star desires to get. On March 22 the director on his Instagram handle had made this announcement. He said about the star kid joining his agency and embarking upon her journey in the universe of Bollywood. <em>He also wrote that Shanaya will be starting to shoot for her film in July.</em></span><em> </em>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CMtctiNp4xA/?igshid=o8wc6y3wbkmw\r\n<h2><b>Is Shanaya Kapoor going to have a successful debut?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karan Johar more than anything is famous for launching star kids. Many of them he launched like <strong>Alia Bhatt</strong>, <strong>Varun Dhawan, Ishan Khattar</strong> are eminent Bollywood actors of today who have proved their worth several times. But, on the other hand, star kids like <strong>Janhvi Kapoor</strong> and <strong>Ananya Pandey</strong> introduced by him though had received stardom are still often criticized for being just a nepotism product and not possessing sufficient acting skills.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> However, it cannot be denied that all of them had grand box-office hit debuts. But since last year the debates on nepotism have become more intense; the result being <strong>Alia Bhaat’s </strong></span><strong><i>Sadak 2</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> becoming the <strong>most disliked</strong> and hated movie of the year. Seems like audiences now are wishing to see and praise more content-driven stuff rather than movies with just glamorous and expensive sets and looks.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Till now we don’t know in what kind of movie Shanaya will be launched or opposite whom she is going to act. We are not here to speak more against or for nepotism. And with a neutral mindset, we wish the upcoming actress all the wishes and luck for her new beginnings. Only time will reveal the future now!</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>Opposite whom?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As mentioned, there is still no official or confirmed report on which actors are going to share the screen space with <strong>Kapoor</strong>. But according to a report of Bollywood Hungama, her debut is going to be with another debutant actor <strong>Lakshaya Lalwani</strong> and the </span><strong><i>Guilty</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fame </span><strong>Gurfateh Pirzada.</strong>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>Public reactions for Shanaya Kapoor</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The announcement has not gone very well with most of the netizens. There had been continuous trolling of Karan Johar for doing the same. The post became flooded with hate comments like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bollywood se bahar bhi logo ko chance to, Chal nikal Karan Johar, She is beautiful but please search for true talent, Aur ek talentless kid, How much money do you get to launch star kids?</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and so on. People even started making memes for expressing dislike against it.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5669 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Shanaya-Kapoor-5.jpg\" alt=\" karan johar\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5670 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Shanaya-Kapoor-1.jpg\" alt=\" karan johar nepotism\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A comparatively very small proportion of the public reacted positively and wished the actress all the best for her new Bollywood career.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>Shanaya Kapoor’s popularity</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People may judge her for being a star kid. But by now she has definitely become a fashion icon with close to attaining <strong>600K followers on Instagram</strong> along with a blue tick on her account.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, there is nothing more to say. As an audience, all I can say is, if the film’s concept is something really good or innovative instead of having a cringy storyline, no one can be stopped from loving or admiring it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, this is the content for today.

Overall, the film keeps the audience hooked to it till the end and leaves a great positive feel-good impact.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9KAoTQlEWs[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>MS Dhoni: The Untold Story</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>IMDB</strong> – 7.8</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Director</strong> – Neeraj Pandey</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Year</strong> – 2016</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Available on:</strong> Disney+Hotstar</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-962 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ms-dhoni-movie.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardly today you can find any individual who has not watched this Bollywood movie. <strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</strong> has always been that successful cricket captain for us.

While the drawbacks of the educational system of India and how the students from lower-middle-class backgrounds drop out of it due to lack of resources have been intactly shown in the film, at the same time the journey of an Anant Kumar from a papad seller to the greatest mathematics tutor of the country has also been beautifully narrated.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is this movie from which many of us got to know about his educational <strong>Super 30 program</strong> where he teaches 30 deserving students to qualify for the difficult <strong>IIT exam.</strong> What adds to its legacy is it\'s receiving the best film award and <strong>Hritik Roshan</strong> winning the best actor award for it at the <strong>Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ag-Col13k[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Paan Singh Tomar:</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>IMDB</strong>: 8.2</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Director</strong>: Tigmanshu Dhulia</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Year</strong>: 2012</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Available on:</strong> Netflix</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1493 size-large\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-min-1024x665.jpg\" alt=\"Irrfan Khan\" width=\"640\" height=\"416\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It a Unique and one of the most praised biographical dramas of all time it has been.

Let’s get to know a little more about this project.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Poster release on Social Media - Ram Setu</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year on the occasion of the Diwali, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/akshay-khiladi-kumar-s-love-for-his-country/\"><strong>Akshay Kumar</strong></a> announced this film via uploading two of its posters on his Instagram handle. In both the posters we witnessed a very intense look of the actor wearing a mud-stained denim shirt and an orange scarf along with a bag hanging from his shoulder, thus giving the perfect look of a researcher or a student.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the background of the poster, there is an image of the sacred Hindu God, Lord Rama along with a phrase comprising of three words,<strong> ‘Myth or Reality.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5685 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ram-Setu-MOVIE-AKSHAY-KUMAR-NEWS-4.jpg\" alt=\"Ram Setu MOVIE AKSHAY KUMAR NEWS (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b>Latest updates regarding the film - Ram Setu</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we believe in the reports, this film will be having a grand theatre release on the occasion of Diwali in the following year 2022.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequently, we also got to know that the chief minister of the state of Uttar Pradesh, <strong>Yogi Adityanath</strong> had granted the actor and the entire team permission to shoot for this Hindi movie in <strong>Ayodhya</strong>, a sacred place for the Hindus known for being the<strong> birthplace of Lord Rama.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News had been surfacing that he will be starting to shoot for this film by the middle of this year. However, recently on March 18th he took to his Instagram account once again and announced the beginning of the film’s shooting along with the eminent and gorgeous actresses, Jacqueline Fernandez and Nusrat Bharucha. It was an auspicious day when the team started to shoot for this film.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5683 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ram-Setu-MOVIE-AKSHAY-KUMAR-NEWS-2.jpg\" alt=\" AKSHAY KUMAR NEWS (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b>Direction and production</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, Akshay Kumar’s own production house is going to co-produce the film. Apart from this, <strong>Abundantia entertainment, Lyca productions</strong> and <strong>Amazon Prime Video</strong> have also joined hands to carry out the production part of this film.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, <strong>Abhishek Sharma</strong> Known for Hindi films like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tere Bin Laden, The Shaukeens</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is going to direct it.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Storyline</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With whatever is came till now, the concept or plot of Ram Setu seems to be quite distinctive. Still now not much is in news about it but it is quite possible, at least evident from the posters, that somewhere the film will lead to a blend of myth and reality.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the Hindu epic, Ramayana, the magical bridge or the Ram Setu had been constructed by none other than Lord Rama to rescue his wife from Lanka (present Sri Lanka) where she was abducted and kept by the evil demon named Ravana. Now while many devoted followers of Hinduism regard this as a historical reality, for many it is a myth. And hence we are all waiting to see how this adventure story from an Indian epic and other values link with the present.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Public reactions – are controversies going to arise?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The situation is quite calm recently. But soon after when the actor had released the poster of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ram Setu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on social media, netizens raised questions and expressed their anger as reactions. Mainly, speaking of the devoted Hindus, it has hurt their religious sentiments and according to many of them now the poster and next to the movie will try to question the existence of the Ram Setu and Lord Rama himself.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5684 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ram-Setu-MOVIE-AKSHAY-KUMAR-NEWS-3.jpg\" alt=\" MOVIE AKSHAY KUMAR NEWS (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h3><strong>Phrase Myth or Reality - RAm Setu</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most specifically, the phrase <strong>Myth or Reality</strong> did not do very well with the general public as the construction of Ram Setu which many Indians still stood today consider a notable historical event, questions are being raised on it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once in the <strong><em>Good News</em></strong> movie, the actor’s one silly joke surrounding Lord Rama had made him get trolled. Now once again Hindu devotees suspected him of trying to defame Rama.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Donations to the construction of Ram Temple</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon after, in January, Akshay Kumar made a video claiming donations to the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Once again, he faced backlashes. And he was accused on grounds that such stunts were being done by him only on account of his upcoming movie.</span>\r\n<h2>Finally</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever be the case, only time will tell whether the movie will really be something unique or something new in the world of Bollywood or will become something rather forgettable. It may give rise to controversies and hurt the sentiments of certain sections of people. But trust me, if the content is really good, no one can stop the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rowdy Rathore</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from giving another box-office hit.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So now, all fingers crossed for the next Diwali of 2022 when the film will come. We wish all the luck to Akshay Kumar and the entire team for their success in this project.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the content for today. We will soon be back with something more interesting about the entertainment industry.

Indian audiences have been highly expecting the release of one such big banner Bollywood film <em><strong>Bunty Aur Babli 2</strong></em> in their nearest cinema halls on <strong>23rd April 2021</strong>. But is it happening or once again the rising Covid cases are creating obstacles in the release of the film?\r\n<h2><strong>Bunty Aur Babli 2 | The anticipated release and the delay</strong></h2>\r\nThis Hindi movie was all scheduled for a grand theatrical release on the 26th of June 2020. However, we are aware of the then countrywide situation when there had been a severe spike in the COVID-19 cases leading to the loss of numerous lives. The theatres were not open. As a result, the release of Bunty Aur Babli 2 also got postponed.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5709 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bunty-Aur-Babli-2-3.jpg\" alt=\"Bunty Aur Babli 2\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nLater the release date come again of the film and it was on April 23rd, 2021. However, in the context of the current situation when once again the COVID cases are rising and lockdowns are newly imposed in different parts of the country, mainly in Maharashtra, the decision has been taken to delay the release of the film yet again. <strong>When it will be released has not yet been announced.</strong>\r\n<h2>Bunty Aur Babli 2 | Teaser or trailer release?</h2>\r\nThe official teaser or trailer of this film is not in news and don\'t know when we will see it. However, on 18th February 2020, a small 27 seconds’ video came on <strong>Yash Raj Films </strong>official account. However, it was not a teaser and we didn’t see any of the actors’ faces. It was just to increase the excitement regarding it.\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmXbi6AkCuo[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>A Sequel?</h2>\r\nThe Bollywood blockbuster, Bunty Aur Babli is still a lovable film of the current generation. So, keeping the popularity and fame of the former movie in mind the team has come up with its sequel, Bunty Aur Babli 2.\r\n<h2>The Star cast of Bunty Aur Babli 2</h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5708 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bunty-Aur-Babli-2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Bunty Aur Babli 2\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThe lead pair of Bunty Aur Babli played by <strong>Rani Mukherjee</strong> and <strong>Abhishek Bacchan</strong> just stole the show. And this time while Mukherjee is still there in the character of one of the female leads, Abhishek Bachchan is no longer a part of the new project.\r\n\r\nIn an interview, she revealed this. She said that both she and Abhishek had been approached for the film. Due to some unfortunate issues, he was not able to manage to be a part of this sequel. And hence, in this part, we are going to see the Bollywood nawab <strong><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/saif-ali-khan-said-about-his-autobiography-reactions-on-twitter/\">Saif Ali Khan</a>.</strong>\r\nAlso, in the character of another lead pair here we are going to see the Gully Boy fame <strong>Siddharth Chaturvedi</strong> and the Prime series The forgotten army: Aazadi Ke Lie actress<strong> Sharvari Wagh.</strong>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5710 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bunty-Aur-Babli-2-4.jpg\" alt=\"Sharvari Wagh hot pic\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2>Direction</h2>\r\nWhile the prequel was directed by the <em>OK Jaanu</em> and <em>Soorma</em> fame, <strong>Shad Ali</strong> it is pretty sure that it has been his filmography and direction that has been one of the major causes behind making it one of the successful big box office hits.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is a matter of grief that Shaad Aali has not returned to direct the sequel Bunty Aur Babli 2.\r\nInstead, this time the responsibility of direction went to the one who had written the script. So yes, the sequel is in direction of <strong>Varun V.</strong> Sharma, a debutant director.\r\n<h2>Production</h2>\r\nThe film is in the production of none other than the <strong>husband of Rani Mukherjee</strong>, <strong>Aditya Chopra</strong> under the banner of <strong>Yash Raj Films.</strong>\r\n<h2>Story so far</h2>\r\nSo, the prequel basically narrated the tale of 2 small village people dreaming to make it big in their lives. Their paths crossed. Finally, they entered the world of conning people to make money as it seemed to be the easiest way. In the backdrop of their Love Story and giving birth to a child, their criminal career finally comes to an end when JCP Dasrath Singh finds his way to the duo and arrests them.\r\n\r\nHowever, they were released from custody soon. And a few years later the policeman offered them to work for the nation by stopping or preventing the activities of other such scammers. With this, the story ended.\r\n<h2>Bunty Aur Babli 2 Storyline</h2>\r\nMuch is not open yet about the sequel’s storyline. However, it is very sure that it’s definitely going to be a continuation of the previous story. Reportedly, the story is going to be narrated in the backdrop of 2 such scammer couples, played by and<strong> Rani - Saif </strong>and <strong>Siddharth - Sharvari.</strong>\r\n\r\nBy a leap of 10 years, the sequel is most probably going to start. Definitely, we are wishing for another mind-blowing, ‘dying out of laughter’ comedy-type movie Bunty Aur Babli.\r\n\r\nWe all really hope that the movie gets released soon and achieves success by becoming a super-duper hit like its prequel. We wish the entire team of Bunty Aur Babli 2 all the luck for their soon-to-be-released project.\r\n\r\nHere at TVFreak.com, we try to provide you with regular updates about the entertainment industry as we are a website solely dedicated to the purpose of entertainment.

Amidst when the entire Giri family was grieving the loss of their son Astik and was busy executing the various traditions to ensure the peaceful departure of his soul, our protagonist set out on her own journey of freeing herself from the familial or societal shackles to find her true identity.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xVqPbvLzX4[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Pagglait</b><b> Star Cast</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The girl who has been winning hearts since the time of Dangal, and gave some appreciable performances in films like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patakaa</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ludo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/sanya-malhotra-story-biography-and-movies/\"><strong>Sanya Malhotra </strong></a>plays the lead, named Sandhya in the film. She has been very natural while her non-makeup looks perfectly complemented her performance throughout the movie.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6195 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Netflixs-Pagglait-Movie-Sania-Malhotara-2.jpg\" alt=\"Netflix’s Pagglait Movie Sania Malhotara (1) cast\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The supporting cast is the second strongest point of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pagglait</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Frankly speaking, the credit goes to them for this extraordinary narration of an ordinary story. Some of the amazing performances have been delivered by actors like <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/the-four-more-shots-please-girl-sayani-gupta-hot-pics-nude-movies-tv-shows/\">Sayani Gupta</a>, Shruti Sharma, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/gorgeous-sheeba-chaddha-biography-husband-movies-tv-shows/\">Sheeba Chadda</a>, Ashutosh Rana, Aasif Khan, Raghuvir Yadav, Meghna Malik, Natasha Rastogi, Jamil Khan, and so on.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6196 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Netflixs-Pagglait-Movie-Sania-Malhotara-3.jpg\" alt=\"Star cast\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b>Performances</b></h2>\r\n<h3><b>Pagglait </b><b>Actress Sanya Malhotra</b></h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6197 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Netflixs-Pagglait-Movie-Sania-Malhotara-4.jpg\" alt=\"Netflix’s Pagglait Movie Sania Malhotara (1) cast\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting from </span><b>Sanya Malhotra</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the way she portrayed her transformation from a dependent-on-husband girl to overcoming different situations and finding her true self is the perfect epitome of graceful acting talent.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> From Sandhya’s ‘I am not affected much from Astik’s death’ attitude to the always-angered </span><b>Tau ji</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s (Raghuvir Yadav) annoying, irritating, and hypocritical comments as well as another uncle named </span><b>Ghanashyam</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s (Jamil Khan) seems-so-fake intellectualness at times add a veil of comic flavour in the film.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Sheeba Chadda – Ashutosh Rana</b></h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6198 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Netflixs-Pagglait-Movie-Sania-Malhotara-5.jpg\" alt=\"Netflix’s Pagglait Sheeba Chadda – Ashutosh Rana\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But at the same time, the </span><b>Sheeba Chadda – Ashutosh Rana</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> duo was seen in the character of Astik’s parents stole the show by the portrayal of how they had been carrying the emotional baggage of their son’s death throughout the film. Along with mourning about Astik’s death, stressing about clearance of house loans in the future. The dead son was managing that when he was alive. All the emotions were there with so much perfection by these 2 natural actors.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Sayani Gupta</b></h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6199 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Netflixs-Pagglait-Movie-Sania-Malhotara-6.jpg\" alt=\"Sayani Gupta\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<b>Sayani Gupta</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s small screen time presence in which she was mostly seen sharing the screen space with Sanaya Malhotra also grabbed the spotlight. It was really heartbreaking to see a strong ambitious successful woman like Akanksha Roy (the name of her character) emotionally breaking down when accused by Sandhya of sleeping with her husband.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of these phases – firstly, a strong economically independent woman living alone in a house. Secondly, this soft-hearted who sobs on bring sadness. Both of them have been carried by Gupta on her shoulders perfectly.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Shruti Sharma</b></h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6200 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Netflixs-Pagglait-Movie-Sania-Malhotara-7.jpg\" alt=\"actress Shruti Sharma\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not to forget </span><b>Shruti Sharma</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who played the role of Nazia, a best friend we all want. She’s the one, in fact only one, who stood by Sandhya irrespective of everything, from eating Golgappas in the first 13 days of her husband’s death to supporting her life-changing decision at the end of the film. She seemed very realistic and a perfect complement to the character of Sandhya.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides, the characters of </span><b>Meghna Malik </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><b>Yamini Singh</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were very life-like in their roles of relatives whom family members try to avoid. Their back bitching about each other as well as about the other members and putting forward useless accusations of different kinds make all of us at least once feel that we all have these kinds of aunties in our family.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Pagglait </b><b>Direction</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another aspect that takes this film to altogether greater heights is the amazing direction and filmography by Umesh Bisht. From the irony to the contrasts to a perfect societal message, he managed to deliver everything with so much flawlessness and magnificence. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Pagglait </b><b>In-depth analysis</b></h2>\r\n<h3><b>Inner meaning:</b></h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6201 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Netflixs-Pagglait-Movie-Sania-Malhotara-8.jpg\" alt=\"Netflix’s Pagglait Movie Sania Malhotara (8)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind what just seems just like a story full of emotions, what makes this film different is the way it tries to show the empathizing conditions of many women in India; especially, the dependent women who do not remain in a position to make decisions for themselves. They acted in the way society wants them to. This clearly reflects in Sandhya’s dialogue mentioning how women were considered Pagglaits once they try to act a different way.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sandhya’s mother is a reflection of many such Indian mothers. She only makes their daughters educated to make her capable of finding a groom earning huge packages.</span>\r\n<h3><b>The irony: </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, definitely, the ironies that have been used in the film are something that cannot be missed out. First of all, the residence of the Girls was shown to have the name, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shanti Kunj</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which is very ironic in the context that there had been hardly any </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shanti</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or peace in the house. The relatives are mostly busy showing each other down and highlighting their own respective achievements, often leading to arguments. </span>\r\n<h3><b>The contrasts:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the film in itself is a contrast. Considering the current situation of the Giri residence where the family members are busy mourning, the film itself unfolds as a light-hearted comedy with a twist in the end.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contrasts in various situations have been portrayed very significantly all through the film. First of all, in the context of maintaining purity in the house the Muslim friend of the protagonist was ordered to eat from somewhere outside. However, at the same time, we witnessed members of the house breaking the 13 days’ rule and smoking and drinking alcohol on the terrace.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, the dull situation of the house is often interrupted with the sound of a doorbell which while ringing plays the loud Bollywood song </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ohh La La</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which is in complete contrast with the house’s grief.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These show that the film itself is in no mood to go by the storyline. It tries to attain a mood of itself.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Pagglait Reviews</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a current IMDB rating of 7.2, the film is one of the favourites of the audience. However, some of the film critics called it boring. But personally speaking, it is a real feel-good movie. And to understand it you need to dive yourself deep into the characters instead of just judging the plot. Overall, it’s worth a watch at least once.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Films like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pagglait </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make us feel that Bollywood has still not lost its essence and how character-driven movies can actually lead to the creation of a cinematic gem.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, this is the Pagglait Reviews.

This movie is directed by </span><b>Simon</b> <b>McQuaid</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and produced by </span><b>James</b> <b>Wan</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The trailer promises us a perfect amalgamation of fantasy elements and violence pushing the martial arts genre to another level. As per the plot is concerned, it’s about a young martial arts fighter who joins another group of fighters in order to fight against the opposition. Although its previous franchises have been a failure, we hope this time the makes do justice to the game. This is set to release in theatres on 16th April and will also be available on </span><b>HBO Max</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYH2sLid0Zc[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>3.

Now comes the month of May when Bollywood will again be back with some of the expectedly amazing movies of the year. So, now let us see what Bollywood has for us in store in May.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Satyameva Jayate 2 | Upcoming Bollywood Movies</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the year 2018, the prequel of this <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/most-handsome-indian-actors-in-bollywood-updated-list-2021/\"><strong>John Abraham</strong></a> starrer has created a lot of hype. But it was not able to keep up with the expectations of the critics; although some sections of the Indian audience have been impressed. Hence on the <strong>13</strong></span><strong>th</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> of May</strong>, the sequel of this <strong>action-packed Hindi movie</strong> will be coming in your nearest theatres.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5893 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/new-released-movies-Bollywood-1.jpg\" alt=\"Satyameva Jayate 2, new released movies Bollywood (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Abraham will be seen in dual roles</strong> (seemingly, the characters of two brothers; one portraying evilness and power misusage to reach a goal while the other portraying the epitome of honesty and determination to attain the same success). <strong>Divya Khosla Kumar</strong> and <strong>Anup Soni</strong> will also be seen in important roles.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let\'s wait and watch whether this <strong>big-budget Bollywood film</strong> comes as a box of surprise or becomes forgettable in course of time. Few of the books and posters that have been released through the teaser or trailer have not yet been resurfaced.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Radhe</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another </span><b>new Hindi movie</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that is going to collide with the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Satyameva Jayate 2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is none other than the much-awaited<a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/radhe-your-most-wanted-bhai-2020/\"><strong> Salman Bhai’s action film </strong></a></span><strong><i>Radhe</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The 3 Khans of Bollywood are known for getting their grand releases in festival seasons and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radhe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is no exception. It will be released in your nearest cinema halls on the <strong>13th of May</strong>, the day of </span><strong><i>Eid-ul-fittar</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3850 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-3.jpg\" alt=\"Radhe Your Most Wanted Bhai (2020)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None other than our Calvin Klein girl<strong> Disha Patani</strong> is going to be seen opposite Salman Khan. While <strong>Jacqueline Fernandez</strong> will steal the show in item dance. Actors like<strong> Randeep Hooda, Jackie Shroff, Gautam Gulati</strong> will also be there in the veil of important characters.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name Radhe has proved to be a <strong>lucky charm for <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/list-of-top-10-most-popular-salman-khan-dialogues-ever/\">Salman Khan</a></strong> when his character of the same name from the 2003 film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tere Naam</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> turned out to be one of the most lovable tragic romantic heroes of all time. And let me make a wild guess! Maybe the titular character of the film will attract a huge part of the audience to go and see it in the hope of getting one more Radhe to speak about.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In <strong>Prabhu Deva’s direction,</strong> now it is a matter of time that will tell whether this film of Bhai also enlists itself in the list of Khan’s successful box-office hits. By now, the first look of the film has got amazing responses. And reportedly the trailer will also be launched soon.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Toofan</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Sports</strong> has always been one of the favourite genres of Bollywood and films like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mary Kom, MS Dhoni</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have always fallen in our list of favourites. Now once again, in the <strong>direction of Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra</strong>, Farhan Akhtar, who has previously stolen hearts in the biopic of the national athlete Milka Singh, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag will now be seen in the character of a national-level boxer.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5894 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/new-released-movies-Bollywood-2.jpg\" alt=\"Toofan, new released movies Bollywood (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Super 30 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actress <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/mrunal-thakur-lifestory-photos-movies-and-tv-shows/\"><strong>Mrunal Thakur</strong> </a>has a pivotal role in the film and<strong> Paresh Rawal</strong> will also be seen in the character of the coach. The film will be having an OTT release and <strong>will stream in Amazon Prime Video</strong> from the 21</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">st</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of May.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A saying has now become popular that all the sports dramas in Bollywood, in recent years mainly, are made fit in the same stereotypical formula and this is one of the reasons why Saina Nehwal’s biopic didn’t do well with the audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s highly hope that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toofan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> breaks this stereotype and we witness exploration of the genre in a unique approach. Its posters have been released. The teaser has also been dropped by Amazon Prime India on the 12</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of March.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RJqgz7WHTg[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Bell Bottom | Upcoming Bollywood Movies</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now comes the time of the </span><strong><i>Khiladi </i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>of Bollywood</strong> whose next release of the anticipated film, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bell Bottom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been scheduled on <strong>May 28. </strong></span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bell Bottom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be expectedly one of the most impressive </span><b>upcoming Bollywood movies in 2021</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3836 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bell-Bottom\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a <strong>spy thriller film</strong> in which <strong>Akshay Kumar</strong> will be seen in the lead role. Eminent actors and actresses like <strong>Vani Kapoor,</strong> <strong>Huma Qureshi, Lara Dutta, </strong>and <strong>Adil Hussain</strong> will be seen in important roles. As of now, this film will also be having a theatrical release on the above-mentioned date. The first look of this film has been dropped on 1</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">st</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> October 2020 and on the 5</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of October its trailer has also been released.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D9g4erlOVE[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The list of </span><b>new released upcoming movies in Bollywood</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> scheduled in May is not very long.

True artists like her get noticed in a movie or soap opera but what most of the Indian audience remembers is their face or acting skills. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, their contributions to Indian cinema are as equally important as those of the lead characters’.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, today we are going to shed light on Amin’s journey and see how she established her foothold in the world of entertainment.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Early life</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much is not known about the actress’s early life but yes…she grew up in the city of Mumbai.

While Hindi movies like the Netflix original, Anurag Kashyap’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ludo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gripped us with its magic, the Hansal Mehta directorial Sony Liv original web series, </span><strong><i>Scam 1992</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> based on the life of the fraud stockbroker of 80s and 90s named Harshad Mehta,</strong> <strong>became the best, award-winning web series of the year</strong> and is in fact, a gem in itself.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call it a coincidence or something else, but within one year of this unforgettable web series’ release, we got to witness a movie loosely based on the life of the same person, Harshad Mehta…Yes, I’m talking about the recently released Kookie Gulati crime drama <strong>Big Bull</strong> which is streaming on <strong>Disney+Hotstar</strong>.</span>\r\n<h2>The Big Question:</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Has Big Bull been successful in outshining </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scam 1992</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or it’s already out of the way of leaving any mark? Read to know more.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3038 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-5.jpg\" alt=\"SCAM 1992 : Behind the Hype\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b>The Big Bull Release</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, due to the ongoing pandemic, the decision of releasing this Hindi film theatrically was called off. Later the makers pushed the release more backwards. This is to give the audience the time to get over the hype that has been created surrounding Scam 1992. But it is true that iconic and unique creations are not easily forgotten.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, soon after the </span><b><i>Big Bull</i></b><b> trailer release</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the public started to react. The </span><b><i>Big Bull</i></b><b> trailer release date</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was three weeks ago before releasing of the film on 8</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> April 2021. Post its release, netizens, especially the Scam 1992 fans, and critics have been comparing the two and consequently, the film is receiving backlashes on grounds of unstructured writing, rushed screenplay, overdramatic dialogues, etc.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw6I-KgCSP4[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Ineffective Writing and overdramatizing of the story</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5858 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/April-movire-released-this-week-2021-4.jpg\" alt=\"The Big Bull, April movire released this week 2021 (4)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Bull,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> it has been unnecessarily tried to make the film typically Bollywoodish</strong> and this is one of the main reasons why it turned out to be so <strong>underwhelming</strong>. One of the major instances of this is the lead character’s love story that has been unnecessarily and forcefully dragged into the plot.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While<a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/scam-1992-the-harshad-mehta-story-behind-the-hype/\"><strong> Scam 1992 had a more realistic approach in showing the journey and determination</strong></a> of an individual, no idea why Big Bull was so keen to show that the protagonist’s setting out on his journey was just motivation of winning over his love interest</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Also, not to miss out on the protagonist’s demonic laughter and the background score accompanied the entry of a corrupt MLA. All these seem to be quite hilarious at some point, particularly when you realize that it is 2021 and the audience no longer admires such over-the-top and over-dramatic portrayals of characters.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Rushed screenplay</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well…Scam 1992 has captured in detail the rise and fall of Harshad Mehta in its 10 long episodes. But for Big Bull, I would like to say that despite being 2 hours 30 minutes long episodes, <strong>the audience failed to connect with the characters</strong>, the main reason being the rushed and too first screenplay.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>It failed to show how the protagonist established himself successfully</strong> in the world of fraud. And hence the storytelling lacked the required depth. It feels like things are happening too fast and we are missing out on information.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Big Bull Performances</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The central character of this film, inspired by the real-life Harshad Mehta, is named Hemant Shah and has been played by none other than the phenomenal and versatile actor <strong>Abishek Bacchan</strong> who has many times proven himself in films like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bunty Aur Bubly, Dostana, Ludo,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and so on. But have the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scam 1992</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fans really able to forgot the breakthrough performance delivered by the Gujarati superstar <strong><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/pratik-gandhi-from-scam-1992-biography-movies-and-web-series/\">Pratik Gandhi</a> </strong>in his debut web series? Absolutely not. However, judging by only the performances both have been ideal in their places and later on. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But considering the faulty over-the-top writing and screenplay, it is not possible for a single actor to make a film masterpiece on his single shoulder. Abhishek has genuinely and energetically tried to give his best but <strong>failed to touch the expectation.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Similarly, in the case of <strong>Sohum Shah</strong>, who has played Hemant Shah’s brother in the film. Again due to the writing, he appeared quite insignificant, particularly, if we compare him to his counterpart, Hemant Kher in Scam 1992. His emotions and the other acts appeared very <strong>unrealistic</strong>.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5953 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> Ileana D Cruz</strong> has been seen in the character of the news reporter in the journey of revealing Hemant Shah’s fraud business. Ileana definitely does justice to her character. But again some of her character’s on-screen doings like barging anytime anywhere without any permission makes us question the authenticity of the film. However, both <strong>Shreya Dhanvantari </strong>and <strong>Ilena</strong> did quite good jobs in portraying the role.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And then there are other efficient actors like Nikita Dutta, Mahesh Manjrekar, Ram Kapoor, Sumit Vyas, Shishir Sharma, Saurabh Shukla in different roles. However, in most cases, their efforts have gone unnoticed due to the lack of strength in the writing.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Background score</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The BGM of Scam 1992 still buzzes in our ears.</strong> On the contrary, while the romantic song </span><strong><i>Ishq Namaz</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seemed to be forcefully fitted in the financial setting of the story, <strong>Carry Minati’s rap</strong> song </span><strong><i>Yalgar</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seemed to be more of a marketing strategy to hype the film. Of course, it is appreciable that finally, Bollywood is acknowledging the efforts of <strong>Indian YouTubers</strong>. But at the same time, it feels like the vibe of Yalgar too doesn’t somewhat match with the environment. Overall the BGM of Big Bull is far beyond touching the level of Scam 1992’s BGM.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1LAtT9u3ag[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, we can say that the film<strong> Big Bull has kinda lost its track</strong> in the way of integrating excessive unnecessary angles like the aspects of romance and over-dramatic emotions. It seems more like half-baked stuff. On the other hand, </span><strong><i>Scam 1992</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> is a gem</strong> from every aspect – storytelling, acting, directing screenplay, and whatnot.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, if you are a Scam 1992 fan, it is quite natural for you to compare the two and conclude the superiority of the web series over the film. Hence, from making aspects, of course, the series is better. But if you haven’t watched it till now, Big Bull is definitely your cup of tea as of now and will not disappoint you. You can give it a one-time watch.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Where can you watch it? – Big Bull movie watch online free</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are having a Disney+Hotstar subscription, you can definitely watch the </span><b>Big Bull Full Movie</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the platform.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several youtube channels where </span><b>Big Bull review in Hindi is available</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

No doubt why Sunny is already a new crash of B-town.</span>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CN2J4xWhPEU/?igshid=1gzseg2ul8lz4\r\n<h2><b>Vidya Balan</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/balanvidya/?hl=en\">Vidya Balan</a> has recently posted a glamorous reel of her house photoshoot. She is very active when it comes to photoshoots and her social media handle is proof of that. Be it in a traditional Indian dress, casual or western outfits Vidya manages to slay in each of them. Her recent photos which stole our gaze at one go include the one in which she was wearing Fabindia\'s yellow-coloured traditional Anarkali type dress where she looked no less than a royal queen. Later, she posted another picture in a casual outfit from Swati Vijayvargie where also she didn’t look any less magical in the white t-shirt, multi-coloured shrug, and a striped trouser.</span>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CNopFSWHNBx/?igshid=1dqodmzuqo0n0\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CNeeSeLnBFf/?igshid=1h6v8033lc5sf\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>Deepika Padukone</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The leading lady of Bollywood, Deepika Padukone, in her recent photoshoot which has been in collaboration with the watch brand named Chopard just looked ravishing. In fact, any word would fall short to describe her beauty in the white coloured dress and of course the Chopard watch which has been increasing the liveliness of the picture. While we became speechless after seeing another version of her beauty, the love of her life Ranvir Singh has not stepped backwards in expressing his heart by commenting ‘Elegance ki Moorat’ and ‘Kya Baat hai, baby’.</span>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CN4w2U-jEn4/?igshid=15lc7m6od8izg\r\n<h2><b>Sunny Leone</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This hottest actress is also not very far behind in the race of dazzling Bollywood photo shoots.

The comment section in itself is proof of how much his fans have loved the pictures.</span>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CNmWshpp4B8/?igshid=yyepz6nfldq4\r\n<h2><b>Kriti Sanon</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luka chupi </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has also recently shot for one of the most popular biggest selling magazines, The Cosmo India. The picture has really been one of its kind with Sanon presenting her glamour and beauty in a white-coloured crop top.

Later, on <strong>11th March 2020,</strong> it arrived on the <strong><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/16-best-bollywood-movies-of-2020-on-netflix-and-amazon-prime/\">OTT platform of Netflix</a>.</strong> </span>\r\n<h2><b>Indoo Ki Jawani storyline</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6228 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Indu-Ki-Jawani-cast-1.jpg\" alt=\"Indu Ki Jawani cast (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With shades of drama, adult comedy, and romance, the film narrates the journey of a small-town girl. Indira Sharma, aka Indoo is the hottest girl of Ghaziabad, the desire of teenage boys to creepy uncles. The narration takes a turn as she gets cheated by her boyfriend whose only desire was to sleep with her.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequently, Indoo, on the persuasion of her best friend downloads a dating app for a one-night stand in order to have a casual hook up and experience for the first time how it feels under the sheets. She even finds a guy and what follows next, a series of hilarious as well as thrilling events, form the main plot of the story. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Indoo Ki Jawani cast</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6229 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Indu-Ki-Jawani-cast-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The free-spirited and prettiest <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/kiara-advani-bio-movies-tv-shows-ads-hot-pics-upcoming-movies/\"><strong>Kiara Advani</strong></a> played the titular character. Opposite her, the Forbidden love actor, <strong>Aditya Seal</strong>, went with the flow with his male lead character of Samar. <strong>Mallika Dua</strong> played Indu’s bestie, Sonal. Actors like <strong>Rakesh Bedi, Rajesh Jais, Vaibhav Palhade, Harsh Sharma, Prabhat Lahari</strong> have been seen in other roles. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Performances of the actors</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me spill the beans here. Acting has been the most and in fact the only positive aspect of the movie which has been overshadowed by very poor writing which we will discuss in the later section. With the portrayal of such a bold character, Kiara tried her best to break the stereotyped image of a shy, sanskari girl she played in films like Kabir Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni: The Untold Story.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it’s really impressive to see her coming out of a comfort zone for a role like this, in this particular film, Malika Dua’s comic timing has outshined hers (it’s totally a personal opinion). With limited screen timing, she stands out in making the audience laugh aloud. Aditya Seal also acts as per the requirement of the script and has been perfect on his part.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shivam Kakkar delivered an entertaining performance in the character of the creepy teenage guy having hots for Indu. Besides these, the on-screen creepy old uncles delivered very realistic performances as well. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Direction and production</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abir Sengupta, a new director, debuted in Bollywood with this movie. Some of the famous production houses, including T-Series, Electric Apples, and Emmay Entertainment have produced this one.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Has it been a success or a gradually forgettable film? - Indoo ki Jawani analysis</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, so the question here arises,<strong> ‘Should you spare your 2 hours to watch this supposedly carefree or light-hearted Bollywood movie?</strong>’ With small towns in the backdrop, romantic films like Chaalang or Baireley ki Barfi have been appreciated by the Indian audience and hence it has been thought that Indu Ki Javani would also leave no stone apart in making us point it out as a feel-good film.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case. While the debutant director has tried to cover various aspects including dating apps, the typical narrow mentality of small-town people, terrorism, India-Pakistan debate the potential actors also tried to make the film likable; but that’s not enough.</span>\r\n<h3>What\'s More?</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today’s era of right-swiping in order to find soulmates, the plot presenting a modern seems to be quite relevant and promising. However, it has not reached our expectations due to faulty and messy writing. In the quest of making, it a full-fledged adult comedy, numerous dialogues on sex, porn, virginity have been incorporated. But the purpose of entertainment of such dialogues have been somewhere lost as most of them seemed to be written with an asinine treatment as well as with a socially debatable or unacceptable perception.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Sonal advises Kiara</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, the fictional character, Sonal continuously advises Kiara’s character that the only way to make a boy fall for her is to have sex with him. Hurts your ears, right? While generally, youths watch such movies, I wonder how badly such lines can influence them. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, while the film’s female-centric approach or the message it gives that how a woman’s sexual desires matter too, it didn’t step back to stereotype UP’s men (be of any age) as those having nothing in life except for sexual desires or hots for a young girl. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the chemistry between the lead pair seems to be quite weak and hence even the last twist fails to leave any mark in the audience’s hearts. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A film that had the potential to be a strong comic spy thriller with masalas of romance, as well as an essence of a small town, turned out to be an unfunny mess trying to touch on so many interesting topics but at last, trying to attract the audience with what? Casual sex. Yes, that’s the truth of this film – trying to sell casual sexism in the name of comedy. It could really have been better to devote more budget into the writing of the film, rather than just spending on the shooting of music videos in such expensive sets.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Oh yes! The songs are appealing, one cannot deny. It’s a treat to the eyes to see Kiara grooving in Sawan Mein Lag Gayi Aag.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwzlUahlfQk[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Indoo ki Jawani IMDB and reviews</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, in all, the film got mostly negative reviews from the critics. The performances, incorporation (though not much successful) of a subplot with thrill and mystery, the songs have been considered a few of the positive aspects of the film. It has got an IMDB rating of 2.6. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it’s on an OTT now, you can go and give it an easy watch once. But of course, if you are a viewer of much better content OTTs are producing these days, you will be quite disappointed by this film.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, this is the content for today.

The audiences and fans then know that actor by the character’s name. Tell me if I say the name </span><b>Phoebe Buffay</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><b>Lisa Kudrow</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which one will you recognize first? But you see, there is no art without an artist. And similarly, there is no Phoebe Buffay without Lisa Kudrow.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Early Life</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6236 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lisa-Kudrow—-Early-Life-Movies-TV-Shows-and-Some-Interesting-Facts-4.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Kudrow— Early Life, Movies &amp; TV Shows and Some Interesting Facts\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lisa Kudrow was born in a middle-class </span><b>Jewish family</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. She even had a </span><b>Bat Mitzvah</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ceremony. Lisa was born and raised in California. She went to </span><b>Portola Middle Schoo</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">l in Tarzana, California. And she completed her high school graduation from Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. She earned her bachelor\'s degree in </span><b>Biology</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from a private college. She had plans to follow her father’s occupation but little did she know. Before starting her acting career Lisa worked as his father’s staff for about 8 years. </span>\r\n<h2><b>So How Did Lisa Kudrow’s Acting Career Start?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess it all started with the help of </span><b>Jon Lovitz</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He was Lisa’s brother\'s childhood friend. By his through, Lisa joined a sketch comedy school called </span><b>The Groundlings</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Her talent was highly appreciated by the members of that troupe. She then for a short period worked with </span><b>Conan O’Brien</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in another comedy troupe. After that, she applied for work in different comedy talk shows and TV shows like </span><b>Saturday Night Live (SNL)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><b>Frasier</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, etc. But all those offers were rejected. In the meanwhile, she appeared in some pilot episodes and talk show segments but none of them was anything significant until the NBC sitcom </span><b>Mad About You</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In this series, she played the role of </span><b>Ursula Buffay</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a waitress. And shortly after that, she was cast in the role of Phoebe Buffay in Friends which changed her life and career forever.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Lisa Kudrow in Friends</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is really hard to believe that Lisa Kudrow plays Ursula before Phoebe. But to be honest her acting as Ursula is what got her the role of Phoebe. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6237 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lisa-Kudrow—-Early-Life-Movies-TV-Shows-and-Some-Interesting-Facts-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It won’t be too exaggerating if I say, </span><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/david-schwimmer-most-popular-movies-tv-series/\"><b>Friends</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the most popular sitcoms of all time. Phoebe Buffay is one of the main six characters who appeared in all ten seasons. Her character is unique. She is a vegetarian, believes in spirits and aura. Lisa also does not believe in evolution, and she never lies. She is very weird, a bad singer but still she is strangely very wise. Playing this role was a big challenge. And for Lisa Kudrow who has never worked in a major acting role before, she pulled off this job with ungodly perfection.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6234 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lisa-Kudrow—-Early-Life-Movies-TV-Shows-and-Some-Interesting-Facts-2.jpg\" alt=\"friends\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<b>Friends (1994-2004) Trailer:</b>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDNNmeeJs1Q[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<b>Friends (1994-2004)</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>IMDb Rating: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8.9</span></li>\r\n <li><b>Star Cast: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer</span></li>\r\n <li><b>Total Episodes: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">235</span></li>\r\n <li><b>Episode Duration: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22 Minutes</span></li>\r\n <li><b>Platform: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HBO Max</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Lisa Kudrow Biography</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>Full Name: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lisa Valerie Kudrow</span></li>\r\n <li><b>Date of Birth: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July 30, 1963 (57)</span></li>\r\n <li><b>Zodiac Sign: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leo</span></li>\r\n <li><b>Birth Place: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encino, Los Angeles, California, USA</span></li>\r\n <li><b>Eye Color: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Light Green</span></li>\r\n <li><b>Hair Color: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown</span></li>\r\n <li><b>Height: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5 feet 8 inches (173 cm)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>Lisa Kudrow Family</b></h2>\r\n<h3><b>Parent:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lisa’s father’s name is</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lee N.

Today, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">TVfreak.com</a> presents to you some of those Bollywood masalas. So, keep on reading till the end.</span>\r\n<h2><b>1. Amir Khan’s probable love affair and its consequence</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6253 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bollywood-secrets.jpg\" alt=\"Bollywood secrets\" width=\"700\" height=\"941\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s begin narrating the dark secrets of Bollywood celebs with the Mr. perfectionist of the industry.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amir Khan, known to give his best when it comes to movies, may have a very happening professional life but his personal life seems to be controversial. While Kiran Rao is his second wife and the duo has a son, Khan has two more children from his first wife Reena Dutta.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wait, there is more when it comes to his love life. He reportedly had a passionate love affair with Jessica Hines, a journalist and the author of Amitabh Bachchan’s biography. In 2004, Jessica gave birth to a baby boy, and allegedly it was Amir Khan’s son whom the actor abandoned. However, they got separated, and Hines went to London with his son who is now a model.</span>\r\n<h2><b>2. Sonakshi’s striking resemblance with Reena Roy – just a sheer coincidence or something else?</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6244 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Top-10-dark-secrets-of-Bollywood-industry-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sonakshi’s striking resemblance with Reena Roy – just a sheer coincidence or something else?\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sonakshi Sinha, the actress known for famous Hindi movies like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Akira, Mission Mangal, Ittefaq, Lootera</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has a striking resemblance with the veteran actress Reena Roy. In this reference, if we go back to a little past, there was a time when a love affair or a physical relationship in Bollywood between Sonakshi’s father, Satrughna Sinha, and Reena Roy had been making headlines.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Sonakshi grew up, her physical appearances began quite similar to that of Reena Roy’s. Here the question arises, is she really the daughter of the couple whom she considers her parents, or is she the illegitimate child of her father and his ex-lover? However, she has always brushed such a possibility calling it to be a rumour; but who knows the truth? </span>\r\n<h2><b>3. The virgin sultan of Bollywood</b></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6245 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Top-10-dark-secrets-of-Bollywood-industry-2.jpg\" alt=\"The virgin sultan of Bollywood\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, I am talking about Salman Khan, the most eligible bachelor of Bollywood. This 55-year-old actor got his name linked with many of the young faces like Katrina Kaif and Jacqueline Fernandez. However, it seems like love has never been his cup of tea and he never tied the knot.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one of the episodes of the famous talk show </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Koffee with Karan,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> he was asked whether he can please someone in bed or not and a lot of buzzes was created when Khan blushed and gently replied that he is still a Virgin. We still don’t know about the real side of Salman Khan and this gives rise to many possible questions like is his dislike ness about sex one of the reasons of him getting never married? Nobody knows.</span>\r\n<h2><b>4. Rishi Kapoor bribed for an award</b></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6246 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Top-10-dark-secrets-of-Bollywood-industry-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest stars of the Indian film industry whom we lost last year is Rishi Kapoor. Undoubtedly, he is one of the finest and talented actors Bollywood has ever got. But his past is also not free from the dirty secrets of the Bollywood industry.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was in 1974 when he bagged the prestigious Best Actor FilmFare Award for his performance in the super hit movie, Bobby. However, in his autobiography, he himself had confessed to having bought the award by bribing an amount of INR 30,000.</span>\r\n<h2><b>5. Ranbir’s active sex life since a young age</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6247 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Top-10-dark-secrets-of-Bollywood-industry-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranbir Kapoor seems to have a playboy image from a very young age. Some of the A-listed actresses of the industry including Deepika, Katrina, and now Alia have fallen for him. Actors usually don’t like revealing much about their past but Kapoor has been an exception.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview, he revealed that just at the age of 15 he lost his virginity and had sexual intercourse with his school girlfriend. However, he always refrained from saying who that girl was and also stated that the relationship didn\'t last for a very long time.</span>\r\n<h2><b>6. Kangana Ranaut, a victim of abuse</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6248 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Top-10-dark-secrets-of-Bollywood-industry-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the many</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dirty secrets of film industry</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">got revealed when the fearless tigress of Bollywood, Kangana Ranaut who now never fails to give an opinion on any matter, admitted being a victim in an abusive relationship with the actor Aditya Pancholi with whom she shares an age difference of about 20 years.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranaut spilt the beans in an interview by saying that it was during the early phase of her career when she was struggling, she had an affair with Aditya Pancholi. However, she admitted that the actor used to physically abuse her but she never spoke about it openly for the sake of her career.</span>\r\n<h2><b>7. Kalki Koechlin\'s favours</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6249 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Top-10-dark-secrets-of-Bollywood-industry-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding dark side of heroines, let’s speak of Kalki Koechlin. The beautiful actress Kalki Koechlin known for her roles in films like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margarita with a straw</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeh Jawani hai Deewani</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has made a very shocking but brave revelation that many actors or actresses cannot. She confessed in an interview that during her initial days to get chances in movies, she used to sleep with directors and producers. And by sleeping I mean having sex.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no such information about this Bollywood actress for night rates. She admitted to stopping such acts she gained success in the industry.</span>\r\n<h2><b>8. Ranveer’s a bad experience</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6250 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Top-10-dark-secrets-of-Bollywood-industry-7.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 dark secrets of Bollywood industry (7)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranveer Singh, now one of the highest-paid as well as most demandable actors in the country, shared one of his disastrous experiences from the initial days of his career and revealed another of the dark dirty secrets of the Bollywood industry.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview, he confessed that a casting director asked him to do a physical favour in order to give him a role. When he said no, the director seemed heartbroken. The director started requesting to give the least favours like letting him touch or see Singh’s private parts.</span>\r\n<h2><b>9. Sunny leone\'s exploration in the world of sex</b></h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6251 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Top-10-dark-secrets-of-Bollywood-industry-8.jpg\" alt=\"Sunny leone\'s exploration in world of sex\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a quite known fact that Sunny Leone started her career as a blue film actress. However, what may sound a little more shocking to you is that her first kiss was at the age of 11. And very soon at the age of 16 or 18 she discovered her bisexuality. In fact, during her career in the porn industry, she decided of doing lesbian scenes.</span>\r\n<h2><b>10.

She was ashamed that being a high school student she did not have a boyfriend. So she took a photo of a random hot guy from the street and showed it to her girlfriends saying that the guy in the picture is her boyfriend. But lying has its consequences, doesn’t it?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erika soon finds out that the guy he took the picture of is actually a student in her school. So to prevent the cat from coming out of the bag, the guy (Sata Kyouya) and Erika make a deal. Sata will pretend to be her boyfriend and in return, Erika will comply with his every command like a dog. Now Sata may seem like a charming guy from the outside but inside he has a sadistic self which will punish Erika to its heart’s content. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This anime also has a live-action adaptation.</span>\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal recommendation: If you liked this anime, </span></i><b><i>Itazura na Kiss</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Mischievous Kiss) is a very similar anime to this.</span></i>\r\n<h2><b>9.

The male lead of this anime is not actually what you call a handsome young man. Gouda Takeo is a giant guy, he is large in both length and width, he has bushy eyebrows, a boring hairstyle, and thick lips. But most importantly he has a heart of gold.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ironically girls can not see that and they don’t want to date him seeing his not so beautiful physical features.

She had been in <strong>Mumbai</strong> all through her school life. She has, in fact, been a good and dedicated student who obtained a whooping 92 percentage in class 12th boards.</span>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6313 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/actress-Kiara-Advani-biography-movies-and-other-interesting-facts-3.jpg\" alt=\"actress childhood\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" /></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After completing her high</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">er secondary level education, she took admission to the famous <strong>Jai Hind college in Mumbai.</strong> She pursued her <strong>graduation</strong> from that educational institute and attained a Bachelors’s degree in <strong>Mass Communication</strong>. In an interview, she opened up a little more about her life before entering Bollywood, she was a part of her mom’s pre-school. She used to take care of the kids, teach them, and even confessed about changing their diapers when required.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiara is a child lover indeed. She said she would love to have her own child someday in order to embrace the heavenly feeling motherhood is.    </span>\r\n<h2><b>Kiara Advani parents and family </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She is not completely from a <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/successful-self-made-bollywood-stars-who-had-no-root-in-industry/\">non-celebrity background as actors like well-known actors</a> like Ashok Kumar and Saeed Jeffrey are her relatives from her mom’s side. However, she is the <strong>daughter of a businessman</strong> named <strong>Jagdeep Advani</strong> and her mother <strong>Genevieve Jeffrey</strong> has been a <strong>teaching professional</strong>. Kiara is not the only child of her parents. She has a younger sibling too, a <strong>brother</strong> named<strong> Misaal Advani. </strong></span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6314 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/actress-Kiara-Advani-biography-movies-and-other-interesting-facts-4.jpg\" alt=\"brother and family\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> (Kiara with her brother)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Friends of the actress</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiara has a very bubbly nature which has led to her making some really close friends in the competitive Bollywood world. Among the actresses, she shares a very good bond with <strong>Aliya Bhatt</strong> and they are often seen together on party-like occasions.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6315 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/actress-Kiara-Advani-biography-movies-and-other-interesting-facts-5.jpg\" alt=\" friendship with alia bhatt\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <strong>Atheya Shetty</strong> is also her close friend and they share a sister-like bonding. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6316 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/actress-Kiara-Advani-biography-movies-and-other-interesting-facts-6.jpg\" alt=\"actress Kiara Advani biography, movies and other interesting facts (6)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her on-screen, as well as off-screen chemistry with <strong><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/vicky-kaushal-biography-filmy-career-and-upcoming-movies/\">Vicky Kaushal</a>,</strong> is definitely worth noting whenever they are spotted together.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> She had developed an adorable friendship with <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/sushant-singh-rajput-facts-journey-to-bollywood/\"><strong>Sushant Singh Rajput</strong></a> as well after working together in MS Dhoni’s biopic; but sadly, it didn’t last long due to the actor’s unfortunate demise last year. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6317 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/actress-Kiara-Advani-biography-movies-and-other-interesting-facts-7.jpg\" alt=\"actress Kiara Advani friends\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from this, not only Kiara herself but also, her entire family shares a very good relation with Salman Khan. <strong>Reportedly, Khan is her mom’s friend since childhood and behind Kiara’s entry into Bollywood too, Salman had great support.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6318 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/actress-Kiara-Advani-biography-movies-and-other-interesting-facts-8.jpg\" alt=\"actress Kiara Advani salman khan\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, we should not miss out on the person whom Kiara considers <strong>her oldest and best friend, i.e, Isha Ambani.</strong> Yeah…you read it right. Kiara’s bestie is the <strong>billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s daughter</strong>, <strong>Isha Ambani</strong>. Not from today, they have been sailing in this boat of friendship since the time both of them were kids (childhood Chaddy buddies is what we can literally call them). In fact, when Isha was engaged, Kiara expressed her emotions on social media by calling Isha her oldest friend. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Kiara Advani Real name</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actress was originally born <strong>Alia Advani,</strong> a name which she later changed before making her debut in Bollywood. The reason behind this is quite apparent. Her contemporary talented actress, the Mahesh Bhatt daughter, Alia Bhatt also possesses the same. If reports are to be believed, this has been the advice of Bollywood’s sultan, Salman Khan; hence, to avoid any clash, Alia changed her name to Kiara. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Kiara Advani Age and physique </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiara is one of the actresses who has reached the peak of success at such a young age. <strong>Born in the year 1992</strong>, she is only <strong>28 years old</strong> as of now. Though she has a cute face, her body is hot and bold enough to turn on the Indian audience. With a <strong>height of about 5’5”</strong>, she has the approximate figure measurements of <strong>34-26-34</strong>. With a perfect figure and the prettiest face bearing a pair of magical eyes, she is truly an epitome of beauty. Below are some of the Kiara Advani hot pics.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6319 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/actress-Kiara-Advani-biography-movies-and-other-interesting-facts-9.jpg\" alt=\"actress Kiara Advani hot photos\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6320 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/actress-Kiara-Advani-biography-movies-and-other-interesting-facts-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b>Kiara Advani Movies and Tv shows</b></h2>\r\n<h3><b>Kiara Advani First/Debut movie | Fugly </b><b>2014:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She started her acting career on the big screen. The year was 2014 when she debuted in Bollywood with a movie named <strong>Fugly</strong>. Though she expected to have a grand Bollywood debut it did not do well at the box office and was not appreciated by the audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, her performance was noted by some critics and it was quite predictable that she would soon rise to fame with her promising talent.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1806 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-min-5.jpg\" alt=\"kiara Advani fugly\" width=\"750\" height=\"480\" />\r\n<h3><b>2016 | Ms Dhoni</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2016, she was seen for a small but pivotal role in the biopic of the ex-cricket captain of India,<strong> Mahendra Singh Dhoni.</strong> In the Hindi film, she played the role of the titular character’s wife, Sakshi Singh Dhoni. It has been such a sweet and elegant character she portrayed. As the song Jab Tak buzzes in our ears, her sequences from it make us fall in love with her character of Sakshi a little more every time. The film was a grand success and gave Advani nationwide fame.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUydWVa9Kyw[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>2017:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2017, this beauty grabbed the female lead role in the thriller film Machine but it did not achieve success and her performance was also not up to the expectation.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLMCnLyowfI[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>2018:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then in 2018, she made her debut in the Telugu film industry opposite Mahesh Babu in the film named Bharat Ane Nenu. Her role was brief in the movie but she successfully turned heads around by delivering a notable performance.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_LGJSeehFA[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Next year, she appeared in one more Telugu film named Vinaya Vidheya Rama.</span>\r\n<h3><b>2018: </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like most of the actors, Kiara had been seeing quite ups and downs in her career until the famous OTT platform, Netflix gave her the much-needed break. It was an anthology film, in fact, a very famous one, Lust Stories where she was seen in the lead role in one of the short films directed by Karan Johar. She played the character of a school teacher named Megha who gets married to a man who is not able to satisfy or please her in bed during sexual intercourse.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiara Advani hot scenes in the movie, especially the one where her pallu drops, giving us a glimpse of her cleavage are really appreciable.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the Kiara Advani sex scenes with Vicky Kaushal in the film where the actor passes out and Kiara’s character wants to be fucked more makes us wonder how the shy girl from MS Dhoni: The Untold Story has transformed and prepared herself for performing such bold steamy scenes in a movie. And of course, how can we miss out on that vibrator scene, the one in which the grandmother mistakes the vibrator as the TV remote, leading to Kiara finally cumming in front of her in-laws.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides showing such elements of adult comedy and romance, this film beautifully delivered the message that how a woman’s desire also matters in a marital relationship; and yes, it is every woman’s right to have sexual pleasure. Kiara’s seductive face, while she was having her time along with the vibrator, became meme material and serves as so till today. </span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74NSJyyjnuY[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>2019:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that, she didn’t look back and started grabbing all the spotlight for films like Kabir Singh and Good Newz in 2019. Her portrayal of Preeti, a medical student full of innocence in the eyes of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kabir Singh</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been highly praised.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGcfUoblbRc[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same year, she gave a special appearance in the period drama Kalank where her performance in the song First class hai alongside Varun Dhawan became a sensation indeed. </span>\r\n<h3><b>2020 | Indoo ki Jawani</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2020, she gave cameo appearances in two of the major hit projects like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Angrezi Medium </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Masaba Masaba</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Netflix once again gave her a major project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guilty</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where she just slew in the character of a cool college-going girl, Nanki Dutta, who sets out on the journey of finding the truth behind a girl’s accusation of Nanki’s boyfriend raped her. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiara appeared in another film last year, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laxmi,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a horror-comedy, one of the most hyped, though hated films of the year, opposite the Khiladi of Bollywood, Akshay Kumar. The age gap between her and her co-actor has been highly criticised as their Jodi looked quite unsuitable for the film. This film got an OTT release on the Disney+Hotstar platform. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her last appearance has been in a very hot and sexy avatar of herself in the film, </span><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/indoo-ki-jawani-read-to-know-its-worth-watching-or-not/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indoo ki Jawani</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a movie that though didn’t receive much praise but is only watchable because of Advani’s performance. She played the character of a girl, Indoo and the movie is about her journey of involving herself in a one-night stand with a stranger on the advice of her best friend, the character played by Malika Dua.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though a theatrical release initially, the film is now available on Netflix and you can watch it there. At least, go and watch it to witness Kiara’s good and bold acting as well as her sexy dance moves as Sawan Mein Lag Gayi Aag plays in the background. </span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwzlUahlfQk[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Kiara Advani Upcoming movies</b></h2>\r\n<h3><b>Shershah: </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, the biographical war movie named </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shershah </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which was has been one of the most awaited projects of 2020 got its release delayed due to the ongoing pandemic and as of now, it is all set to have a theatrical release on the 2nd of July this year, which is again indefinite due to the recent surges in the COVID-19 cases. Kiara will be seen in the female lead role in this film, opposite the hot actor Siddharth Malhotra who will reportedly be playing a double role of twin brothers. The story is based on the life of the courageous army captain Vikram Batra. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Apart from this, she has also been cast to play the main role in Bhool Bhulaiyaa’s sequel, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bhool bhuliya 2,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> opposite Kaartik Aryan. There is much high anticipation about this movie as the first part has really been a high success and people are thinking about whether the Kaartik-Kiara duo will be able to create that old magic on the screen once again, However, its filming has been halted due to the pandemic situation. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Jug Jug Jeeyo:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Hindi movies of Advani are in the line to get released. These include Jug Jug Jeeyo, a perfectly packaged film with elements of romance and drama starring eminent actors like Neetu Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Varun Dhawan. It also stars the Bollywood newcomer Prajakta Kohli in a pivotal role. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Mr. Lele: </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, Mr. Lele is the last project she has signed till now which is also still undergoing the filming process. In this movie, once again, we will be going to witness Kiara and Vicky together. The Bhoot actor Bhoomi Pednakar is also a part of the cast. Reportedly, the Dhadak actress Janvi Kapoor is selected for the character Kiara is going to portray, but later Kiara replaced her. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Music videos</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before sharing intimate and romantic scenes in Kabir Singh, the Shahid-Kiara duo has appeared in a music video, Urvashi Remix, the singer of which is none other than the most well-known Indian rapper and singer, Honey Singh. It has been Kiara’s music video debut in the year 2018. While Shahid Kapoor looked extremely handsome and did some amazing dance moves, the way Kiara grooved with the music is also worth praising.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv1942uOzFA[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Awards and achievements</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the beginning of her career, besides receiving love and praises from the audiences and critics, she has been the recipient of some prestigious awards as well. Till date, she won one award for her performance in Bharat Ane Nenu in the year 2019. And in the same year, she bagged the Asiavision award of Emerging Star of the Year. Besides these, she received nominations for her works in Kabir Singh, Fugly, Guilty. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Other works</b></h2>\r\n<h3><b>Kiara Advani Ads:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This beautiful actress has also stolen our hearts by her small-time screen appearances in advertisements where she has been seen endorsing various products.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have seen her in a sporty, yet sexy look in a Marie biscuit ad. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, she has been seen in a professional office look flaunting her hair in a Pantene advertisement.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like this, she has appeared in many such advertisements, including those of Myntra, Oppo F9 Pro, Ponds cream, Colgate and Mebaz.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nScYcNrqmg[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-TrqPG3EYw[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, another notable one is the adorable ad of Housing.com where we once again got to witness the memorable Kiara-Vicky pair from Lust Stories sharing the screen.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGRjW5OeMuM[/embedyt]\r\n<h3><b>Ramp walks:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has also very recently, in March, did a ramp walk as a part of Lakme fashion week. Kiara looked drop-dead gorgeous in the silver-coloured outfit designed by none other than the great designer of all time, Manish Malhotra. She just slew in the ramp walk along with Kartik Aaryan.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Featured on magazine covers: </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiara has also been the face of famous magazine covers. She has recently posed for ELLE India where the black coloured dress just complimented her seductive look.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6321 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Featured-on-magazine-covers-Kiara-Advani-1.jpg\" alt=\"Featured on magazine covers Kiara Advani (1)\" width=\"696\" height=\"870\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> She has also appeared in some ravishing outfits on the cover page of magazines like Brides Today, Cosmopolitan, Vogue and Femina. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6322 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Featured-on-magazine-covers-Kiara-Advani-2.jpg\" alt=\"Featured on magazine covers Kiara Advani (1)\" width=\"474\" height=\"637\" />\r\n<h2><strong>K</strong><b>iara Advani naked – The iconic Kiara Advani Dabboo Ratnani Photo</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the iconic Bollywood divas, including Aliya Bhatt, Disha Patni, Katrina Kaif, Vidya Balan went topless in front of the famous photographer, Dabboo Ratnani’s camera and has created a buzz all over the internet by showing off their body curves.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiara is also one of those actresses who posed for Ratnani, with just a leaf in her hand; yes, just a green coloured leaf! the rest of her body did not have a single lining of cloth. ‘Hot as a fire’ is the perfect phrase that will go with that almost Kiara Advani nude picture. ‘Lucky photographer’, I must say. Her perfectly toned curved body made her look no less than an appealing sex goddess.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon after the picture, social media lost its calm and her comment section started getting comments from her fans as well as colleagues. Bold steps like these that Kiara has been taking will surely guarantee a bright career of hers in the movie industry in near future. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6324 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kiara-advani-hot-dabboo-ratnani-photoshoot-2.jpg\" alt=\"kiara advani hot dabboo ratnani photoshoot (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6323 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kiara-advani-hot-dabboo-ratnani-photoshoot-1.jpg\" alt=\"kiara advani hot dabboo ratnani photoshoot (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b>Kiara Advani boobs, ass, bikini pictures</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiara Advani Instagram is so full of her hot pictures which can really steal your glances even if you are not a diehard fan of hers. Indeed, she has a body to flaunt and does so in most of her photoshoots. She is very active on social media and always keeps her fans and admirers updated with personal as well as professional happenings of her life. She has really created a huge fan base in all these years which is quite evident from the number of followers she has on Instagram, 17.5 million. And of course, this number is on a rise every day. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6325 size-large\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kiara-Advani-hot-pics-1-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Kiara Advani hot pics (1)\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6326 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kiara-Advani-hot-pics-2.jpg\" alt=\"Kiara Advani hot pics (1)\" width=\"448\" height=\"679\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6327 size-large\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kiara-Advani-hot-pics-3-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Kiara Advani hot pics (1)\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6328 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kiara-Advani-hot-pics-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"1138\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6329 size-large\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kiara-Advani-hot-pics-5-753x1024.jpg\" alt=\" hot pics (1)\" width=\"753\" height=\"1024\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6330 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kiara-Advani-hot-pics-6.jpg\" alt=\"instgram hot pics (1)\" width=\"849\" height=\"565\" />\r\n<h2><b>Kiara Advani boyfriend and relationships</b></h2>\r\n<h3><b>With Mohit Marwah: </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, Kiara topped the entertainment headlines very soon after her debut when her name had been linked with her Fugly co-star Mohit Marwah. However, as per reports, the couple broke up later as Marwah found someone else and cheated on Advani. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6333 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kiara-advani-boyfriend-mohit-marwah-1.jpg\" alt=\"boyfriend mohit marwah (1)\" width=\"554\" height=\"565\" />\r\n<h3><b>With Siddharth Malhotra:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post that, Kiara became extremely private when it comes to her professional or love life. However, what is Bollywood without masalas and gossip? This gorgeous actress has also not been successful in keeping herself away from rumours (or just another instance of celebs hiding secret affairs is what we must say? Your call).</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6332 size-large\" style=\"font-weight: inherit;\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kiara-advani-boyfriend-siddharth-malohtara-1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\" boyfriend siddharth malohtara (1)\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has been r</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;\">umoured to have a love affair with one of her co-stars, none other than the charming Student of the Year actor Siddharth Malhotra. But the duo has always denied such allegations of them being the new love birds of B-town. Later in an interview, Kiara opened up about Siddharth. She told that it had been during the shooting period of Shershah when she got to know him well. She also called him intelligent. Is something finally blooming between the two? Only time will tell.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from this, Kiara did not yet get involvement in any such controversy regarding relationships. So, as she says, there is no affair with Malhotra too, she is single as of now. It really seems like the actress is highly focusing on her career and ambitions and has no time for love in her life or maybe she has not found the perfect one yet. Whatever be the case, we really wish that Kiara gets to meet the prince charming of her life soon. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Kiara Advani net worth = 22 Crore</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within a very short span of time, Kiara has established herself as one of the most successful Bollywood actresses and most of her works create buzz among the Indian audience. Apart from movies, she earns from photoshoots as well as brand endorsements and advertisements. As of 2021, she has a net worth of about INR 22 crores. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, what I would like to say is that the Indian film industry needs to utilise gems like Kiara Advani more efficiently and give them more powerful and challenging roles. Maybe it has been Salman Khan who had a great hand behind Kiara embarking upon her acting journey; maybe she has her relatives who have connections in or to Bollywood, but we definitely cannot deny the talent she possesses.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has not yet been a decade since she is in the industry and she has already become one of our most favourite artists of current times. As the audience, we do believe that the actress has great potential to rule the world of Bollywood if given the proper projects and opportunities. All our best wishes to Kiara Advani; we wish to see her diversifying her horizon and become more versatile as an actress with every passing year. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, finally, this is the content for today. I think the way we deeply dived into Kiara Advani’s life and discussed so many aspects of it, you found it interesting and had a happy reading. We will soon come back with another inspiring journey of any other favourite artist of yours. Besides these, we also give regular updates about various in the entertainment world; we give movie or web series suggestions as well. So don’t forget to stay updated with us.

Today, let’s go down the memory lane and revisit the </span><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-15-movies-on-friendship-that-you-must-watch/\"><b>best friendship movies</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hindi cinema’s best onscreen trios</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who have never left any stone apart to entertain us.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><i>1. Dil Chahta hai</i> </strong></h2>\r\n<b>Akshay – Sameer – Siddharth:</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name itself is enough to reveal which of the </span>Bollywood friendship movies<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we are talking about. The heart-touching iconic film of 2001 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dil Chahta hai</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is still a favourite of many. A perfect movie to watch with your friends if you are uniting with them after a long time. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plots beautifully show how after college, circumstances made three friends get separated from each other but ultimately the inevitable force of friendship brings them all together back again. Eminent actors like Amir Khan, Akshay Khanna, and Saif Ali Khan have so realistically played the roles that for every single moment as the movie progresses, we feel like we are also a part of their journey.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBAcYSSUf6o[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong><i>2. 3 idiots | Bollywood friendship movies</i></strong></h2>\r\n<b>Rancho – Raju – Farhan:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Another one of the lovable </span>best Bollywood movies on friendship<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been this 2009’s award-winning film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 idiots</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where the worth remembering characters of Rancho, Farhan, and Raju portrayed by Amir Khan, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi respectively in.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite having lots of differences, these three friends, throughout the movie, always stick to each other no matter what. Indeed, a must-watch for today’s generation which never thinks even once to leave their friends behind to be a part of the competitive rat race. It’s admirable to see how Rancho always tops in the college while Farhan and Raju despite failing never leaves each other’s back.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it is finally their friendship that motivated them to follow their passion and become successful in their respective lives. The last scene of the film where the three friends reunite and Rancho kisses his ladylove makes us emotional every time we watch it.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0eDlFX9GMc[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong><i>3. Kiapoche</i></strong></h2>\r\n<b>Ishaan – Omi - Govind: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the Hindi</span> movies about 3 friends <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enough to make us cry is this 2013’s unforgettable cinematic gem, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiapoche.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A group of three friends who have been always with each other through thick and thin starts a business venture together, faces a tragic ending when religion and politics come in the way of their friendship and they have to sacrifice one of them, the regret of which stays forever.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ishaan, played by the legendary late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, loses his life in the hands of Omi (portrayed by Amit Sadh). The film ends as Omi and Govind, after years, discuss their old days with Ishaan whose spirit smiles from heaven as their dream of seeing their neighbourhood kid Ali getting into the Indian cricket team finally gets fulfilled.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGSyqEOo8k8[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong><i>4. Dostana | Bollywood friendship movies</i></strong></h2>\r\n<b>Sam – Neha – Kunal: </b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jaane Kyun</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is still one of the top songs on our playlist. While the song buzzes in our ears, the music video is also one of our favourites because of the way it portraits the chemistry between three friends, played by Priyanka Chopra, Abhishek Bachchan, and John Abraham. By now you must be knowing that we are talking about the movie </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dostana</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which beautifully narrates the tale of how three people from different spheres of life met and got along with each other and finally became the best of friends.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is one of those </span><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/best-bollywood-romantic-movies-to-watch-on-valentines-day-2021/\"><b>Bollywood movies about best friends falling in love</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which distances them from each other.

The adventurous, as well as the funny journey of three young friends who set out on a road trip to Spain, is indeed a happy watch. Having the best times of their lives, undertaking all the fun sports, meeting some amazing persons, and finally having some self-realizations as well as understanding the value of the bond they share form the main plot of the story. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All happens in the course of the trip. Love, comedy, friendship, drama, adventure – a mixture of all these elements, ZNMD is truly one of the best movies of all times, one of the </span>best Bollywood movies about friendship<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; of course, we shouldn’t miss out on the cast, Hrithik Roshan, Farhan Akhtar and Abhay Deol who are its shining stars.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrpcDgC3zU[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong><i>6.

Even after 21 years, we can still say that each scene of this film is better than the previous one and will always make you die out of laughter. The story is about the trio\'s quest to become rich.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj4H-X3FAWU[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong><i>7. Pyar Ka Punchnama 2</i> </strong></h2>\r\n<b>Gogo – Thakur – Chauka:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> One of the most entertaining buddy dramas and in fact, one of the favourites among today\'s youths is this Luv Ranjan-directed film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pyar Ka Punchnama 2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where we saw Kartik Aryan, Sunny Singh, and Omkar Kapoor in the lead characters of three best friends. This film is the perfect epitome of how friendship is over everything our friendship and is the best gift we have ever received, how in the most distressing days it is only those friends who can make us feel happy and good about ourselves; in fact, while the loves of their lives walked away it has been just three of them in the bar chilling out with each other, thus showing that no matter how many people come and leave, their friendship is going to remain the same forever.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC-HGUhxyyc[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong><i>8.

Full of comedy sequences as well as horror ones, the film also showcases the extent to which buddies can go in order to protect or save each other from anything and anyone. After all, that’s what friends are for.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzeaGcLLl_A[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><strong><i>9. Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani</i></strong></h2>\r\n<b>Bunny – Aditi – Avi:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Well, while the romance between Bunny (Ranbir Kapoor) and Naina (Deepika Padukone) is going to make you emotional, the friendship shared between Bunny, Avi, Aditi portrayed by RK, Aditya Roy Kapoor, and Kalki Koechlin respectively, is also something that we can never get over from Ayan Mukherjee’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From food to happiness and pain the squad shared it all. Life happened which did separate them from each other, but finally years later when the trio met, they cleared out all the misunderstandings, embraced each other, and became best buddies once again.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbp2XUSeUNE[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><i>10. Mitron</i></h2>\r\n<b>Jai – Raunak – Deepu:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Though the main focus of this 2018 film remains on the love story of Jai and Avni, it also portrays the strong bond the main character shares with two of his buddies Raunak and Deepu, played by the Scam 1992 actor Prateik Gandhi and Shivam Parekh respectively.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jai, who is considered as a ‘good for nothing’ guy by his dad always got his friends’ moral and financial support, without which it would surely be not possible for him to think positively about life. Raunak and Deepu stayed with Jai throughout his good as well as bad days and the trio has really given us friendship goals in a true sense.</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7oSVaQp6CM[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So, these are some of the </span>3 friends movies in Bollywood<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you should of course not miss out on.

And finally, they met with very disastrous consequences.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This plot is inspired by an incident, the victim of which has been a Delhi girl named Deepika. She went with her boyfriend to an abandoned strange house away from the city and while the duo was having sex, the guy suddenly got possessed started blabbering in Marathi\'s language. It made the girl unconscious in fear.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later that night, she was rescued but her bf was never traced again. However, as they were recording the love-making session, she had the footage of everything that happened, based on which later this film was made.</span>\r\n<h2><b></b><b>2.

It was June 2011.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A month later another oil tanker was discovered abandoned along the same beach after it was untraceable for many days. These two bizarre incidents inspired the making of this movie. The addition of the horror on a haunted angle along with elements like thrill and suspense has indeed made it scary.</span>\r\n<h2><b>3.

Though the approach to this film has been entertaining and full of comedies, the trailer itself revealed that the story is based on a ‘ridiculously true phenomenon</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We don’t know if such a witch exists in real or not, but a similar legend snatched away the night’s sleep of 1990’s Bangalore city. People reported that there used to be knocks on the door at night and many unfamiliar killings or murders took place as well. As per folklore, a witch comes out at night and calls men from outside their houses in someone’s voice they love. And then the man would die within the next 24 hours. The residents of the city gradually found a solution to this - Naleba which means ‘come tomorrow’. They used to write this outside their doors so that spirit would go away every night.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people’s fears are quite evident from the fact that even today the 1st of April is celebrated as Naleba body. Similarly, the film also made us witness how residents of the Chanderi town of Madhya Pradesh were traumatized by Stree’s presence and as a solution wrote ‘oi Stree kal aana’ (come tomorrow) outside their houses every night.</span>\r\n<h2><b>4. ?: A Question mark:</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>IMDB</strong>: 5.6</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Directed by:</strong> Allyson Patel, Yash Dave</span></li>\r\n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Available on:</strong> YouTube</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6294 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10-Bollywood-horror-movies-on-true-stories-3.jpg\" alt=\"10 Bollywood horror movies on true stories (8)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reportedly, this blood-curdling award-winning horror film is also partially based on a true incident.

Also, the back story of Manjulika is believed to have actually taken place about 200 years ago from today. As per sources she used to be a poor Bengali dancer who was kidnapped and brought to India. She met a male dancer named Shashidhar and the duo fell in love. However, the king killed Shashidhar to be with Manjulika himself.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She later committed suicide but in the suicide note promised to take revenge.

It has recreated many historical figures or even fictional characters in unique unforgettable ways. While some of those films emerged as box-office blockbusters, some of them received mixed reviews.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, keeping the plot or script aside, today let’s talk about the beautifully designed royal dresses in which our favourite actresses have stolen our hearts from time to time in </span><b><a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/\">Bollywood movies</a> that influenced fashion.</b>\r\n<h2><b></b><b>Deepika Padukone in </b><b><i>Bajirao Mastani</i></b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the masterpieces created by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. This, 2015 period film has magnificently narrated the love story between Maratha Peshwa Bajirao and his second wife, Mastani.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6343 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Deepika-Padukone-in-Bajirao-Mastani-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deepika Padukone portrayed the character of Mastani who was also the princess of a Rajput kingdom. From the beginning to the end of the film, she was all clad in royal outfits. She has been a perfect complement to the natural beauty she already has.</span>\r\n<h3>About her Look:</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I personally got obsessed with her nose ring and the golden-coloured </span><b>Anarkali dress look</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she wore during the song </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deewani Mastani. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also looked no less than a goddess in the red-coloured lehenga in which she was also seen in one of the movie posters sharing a romantic pose with co-actor Ranvir Singh. Lastly, the traditional Marathi look completed with the maroon saree and jewellery during the Pinga dance can’t be missed out. Anju Modi is indeed a brilliant designer.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6342 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Deepika-Padukone-in-Bajirao-Mastani-1.jpg\" alt=\"1 Deepika Padukone in Bajirao Mastani (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6344 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Deepika-Padukone-in-Bajirao-Mastani-3.jpg\" alt=\"1 Deepika Padukone in Bajirao Mastani (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<b style=\"font-size: 1.7em; font-style: inherit;\">Alia Bhatt in </b><b style=\"font-size: 1.7em; font-style: inherit;\"><i>Kalank</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A film that tried to narrate a heart-breaking tale of love from the pre-independence era did not do well with the audience. However, no one can bet on the expensive sets and gorgeous costumes that have been designed for it. Alia Bhatt radiated royalty as she played the female lead character of Roop in the film.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6345 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-Alia-Bhatt-look-in-Kalank-1.jpg\" alt=\"2 Alia Bhatt look in Kalank (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, This was the very first look at the movie. In it, the actress had made us spellbound with her iconic red dupatta ‘attired-with-all-the-jewellery’ royal bridal look. Also, when she danced as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ghar More Pardesiya</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> played in the background, her white-coloured full-sleeved lehenga made us fall in love with her beauty. Even the minimal makeup complemented with just a bindi and a pair of earrings made Bhatt look like a fairy. All credits to the all-time-favourite fashion designer Manish Malhotra, the creator of </span><b>best costumes in Bollywood movies.</b>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6346 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-Alia-Bhatt-look-in-Kalank-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6347 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-Alia-Bhatt-look-in-Kalank-3.jpg\" alt=\"2 Alia Bhatt look in Kalank (3)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b>Aishwariya Rai Bacchan in </b><b><i>Jodha Akbar </i></b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of </span><b>iconic Bollywood characters costumes</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, now let’s go back to 2008 when Ashutosh Gwarikaer created on-screen magic in the film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jodha Akbar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and indeed took us to the Mughal era. The evergreen diva Aishwarya Rai played the role of a Rajput Princess who gets married to emperor Akbar as a result of an alliance.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6350 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Aishwariya-Rai-Bacchan-in-Jodha-Akbar-3.jpg\" alt=\"3 Aishwariya Rai Bacchan in Jodha Akbar  (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The story moves forward as the duo falls in love. Coming back to Aishwariya, she was the epitome of royalty throughout the movie. The actress looked drop-dead gorgeous in the light makeup along with the heavy jewellery she wore for most of the scenes. The royal Rajasthani essence that her look generated is worth appreciable. Thanks to well-known designer Neeta Lulla for giving us such royal outfit goals.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6349 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Aishwariya-Rai-Bacchan-in-Jodha-Akbar-2.jpg\" alt=\"3 Aishwariya Rai Bacchan in Jodha Akbar  (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6348 size-full\" style=\"font-weight: inherit;\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-Aishwariya-Rai-Bacchan-in-Jodha-Akbar-1.jpg\" alt=\"3 Aishwariya Rai Bacchan in Jodha Akbar  (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b></b><b>Kangana Ranaut in </b><b><i>Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi</i></b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A blend of royalty, power, and courage has been flawlessly portrayed by Ranaut as she played the character of the great freedom fighter Rani Laxmi Bai, aka Queen of Jhansi, one of her major successful projects now. Even in such a fierce avatar, she made us impressed with her ethnic royal looks every time she appeared on the screen.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6351 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-Kangana-Ranaut-in-Manikarnika-The-Queen-of-Jhansi-1.jpg\" alt=\"4 Kangana Ranaut in Manikarnika The Queen of Jhansi (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Firstly, in the whitish-golden coloured outfit. The beauty generated by this </span><b>Bollywood actress in a salwar suit</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can’t be explained in words. And then the most favourite of all is the one in which she was wearing a red colour saree with a lining of green. It was decked up in all the ornaments. Just like in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jodha Akbar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the magical </span><b>famous Bollywood costumes</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had been made by none other than Neeta Lulla.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6352 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-Kangana-Ranaut-in-Manikarnika-The-Queen-of-Jhansi-2.jpg\" alt=\"4 Kangana Ranaut in Manikarnika The Queen of Jhansi (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b></b><b>Hema Malini in </b><b><i>Razia Sultan</i></b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This period biopic, made in 1983, is based on the life of the only woman sultan of Delhi. The titular character was portrayed by the dream girl of Bollywood, Hema Malini. It traces the epic story of the romance between her and her slave.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6353 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5-Hema-Malini-in-Razia-Sultan-1.jpg\" alt=\"5 Hema Malini in Razia Sultan (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being a film of that era, this cult classic never fails to give all the vibes of the sultanate era. While the cinematography and direction are worth praising, Hema Malini’s royal outfits made us feel as if Razia Sultan had indeed come alive from the pages of history. The royal </span><b>celebrity Anarkali suits</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the turban were perfect to create that sultanate look and make us admire the </span><b>old Bollywood fashion</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a true sense.</span>\r\n\r\n<b> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6354 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5-Hema-Malini-in-Razia-Sultan-2.jpg\" alt=\"5 Hema Malini in Razia Sultan (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" /></b>\r\n<h2><b></b><b>Kajol in </b><b><i>Tanhaji The Unsung Warrior</i></b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kajol’s Maharashtrian look is worth mentioning in this list. Her ethnic traditional outfits combined with superior acting made it look as if she was the only one made for the character of Savitribai Malusare, the wife of the titular character played by Ajay Devgan. She was not a queen or princess in the film; instead, she was the better half of a Sardar; still, she managed to look breathtakingly beautiful even in the simple sarees.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was the light ornaments that indeed did a great job of giving an ancestral royal touch to her entire look. All credits go to designer Nachiket Barve for such brilliant styling of the actress.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6356 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/6-Kajol-in-Tanhaji-The-Unsung-Warrior-2.jpg\" alt=\"6 Kajol in Tanhaji The Unsung Warrior (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6355 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/6-Kajol-in-Tanhaji-The-Unsung-Warrior-1.jpg\" alt=\"6 Kajol in Tanhaji The Unsung Warrior (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b>Zarine Khan in </b><b><i>Veer</i></b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hot and beautiful actress Zarine Khan made her debut with this Salman Khan. This was a period action Bollywood film in the year 2010. And in her very first project, she successfully gave us some major royal outfit goals.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I must say that she carried those looks very sportingly. Hence despite her not-so-impressive acting, we can’t stop ourselves from admiring her character of Princess Yashodhara. One of the most favourite looks is the bridal look of hers. She was wearing a red lehenga with the dupatta covering her head while wearing beautifully made jewellery.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In another scene, she was seen in a yellow-coloured royal outfit in which she managed to look equally gorgeous. In this way, more of her looks just stole away our gazes.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6357 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/7-Zarine-Khan-in-Veer-1.jpg\" alt=\"7 Zarine Khan in Veer (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6359 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/7-Zarine-Khan-in-Veer-3.jpg\" alt=\"7 Zarine Khan in Veer (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6358 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/7-Zarine-Khan-in-Veer-2.jpg\" alt=\"7 Zarine Khan in Veer (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b>Priyanka Chopra in </b><b><i>Bajirao Mastani</i></b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while everyone praises Deepika’s look from the film, we hardly talk about PC’s portrayal of Kashibai as well as the strong royal Marathi queen look she carried out. For the character, this global icon developed a powerful personality trait that suited perfectly with the traditional royal sarees and jewellery she was made to wear. Her dresses were also designed by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anju Modi and are truly one of the worth remembering </span><a href=\"https://www.limeroad.com/bollywood-collection\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Bollywood outfits</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ever designed till now.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6360 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8-Priyanka-Chopra-in-Bajirao-Mastani.jpg\" alt=\"8 Priyanka Chopra in Bajirao Mastani\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b></b><b>Kareena Kapoor Khan in </b><b><i>Asoka</i></b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bebo is famous for carrying out ravishing looks in Hindi movies efficiently. From being the influencer Poo of Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham to being the simply dressed journalist of Satyagraha, the actress has always slain the outfit game of Bollywood. In this period biographical movie, which narrates how the war of Kalinga changed emperor Asoka’s life, she played the character of Princess Kaurwaki of Kalinga, opposite Shah Rukh Khan.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, unlike other princesses or queens, she was not draped in jewellery. Though she had worn the least ornaments, it has been her body art and out-of-the-box refreshing outfits that created the magic of royalty. Manish Malhotra and Anu Vardhan designed the dresses.  </span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6361 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/9-Kareena-Kapoor-Khan-in-Asoka.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b></b><b>Karishma Kapoor in </b><b><i>Zubeidaa </i></b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karishma Kapoor’s titular character in this film falls for a maharaja, played by Manoj Bajpayee and marries him. So, in that manner, she plays a queen in the movie. She represented royalty as Zubeidaa in the most elegant way and that’s the best part of the movie. Her chiffon sarees and jewellery indeed made her look ravishing.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6362 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10-Karishma-Kapoor-in-Zubeidaa-.jpg\" alt=\"10 Karishma Kapoor in Zubeidaa \" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><b></b><b>Deepika Padukone in </b><b><i>Padmavat</i></b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The beginning and ending are definitely perfect with the queen of Bollywood.

She has awestricken us by the way she handled the challenging character as well as the heavy dresses and jewellery. She was mostly in traditional Rajasthani ghagra. The best one has been the red coloured ghagra with golden embroidered designs all over it, i.e., the one she wore for the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ghoomar </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dance.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6363 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-Deepika-Padukone-in-Padmavat-1.jpg\" alt=\"11 Deepika Padukone in Padmavat (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, the actress looked ethereal in those dresses and ornaments consisting of bangles, nose rings, chokers, etc. The dresses were designed by the super talented Rimple and Harpreet Narula.</span>\r\n<h2>Finally</h2>\r\n<b>Costume designing in Indian movies </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by renowned designers is a major way to make the audience hype about the films.

It was released on the<a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/16-best-bollywood-movies-of-2020-on-netflix-and-amazon-prime/\"> OTT platform</a>. It is a sequel of Drishyam which was a blockbuster in the year 2013.\r\n<h2>Director, Cast of Drishyam 2</h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6373 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Drishyam-2-The-Resumption-review-2.jpg\" alt=\"Drishyam 2 The Resumption review (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nIt was written and directed by Jeethu Joseph. The movie was based on a crime thriller. In this movie, we can see Mohanlal, Meena, Asha Sharath, and Siddiqui sharing the screen space. It was a super hit blockbuster movie that attracted the audience to the theatre.\r\n<h2>Language of Drishyam 2</h2>\r\nFor this outstanding box office collection, this movie was remade in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada by some of the biggest male stars of those industries.\r\n<h2>Trailer:</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-nd1uGsjQ\r\n<h2>What\'s So Special</h2>\r\nIn recent times, Malayalam crime thrillers are becoming the talk to the town. The director of this movie Jeethu Joseph is the actual hero in these two sequels. He proved once again and showed his master class in the Sequel Drishyam 2: The Resumption. Right from the opening scene, each frame was well connected to the first version.\r\n\r\nThe detailing for each scene was simply mind-blowing to watch. Most of the characters played in the first version were retained and only a few new faces played their part in the sequel. But everything was perfectly synced with the plot.\r\n<h2>The Ultimate Suspense</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6374 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Drishyam-2-The-Resumption-review-3.jpg\" alt=\"Drishyam 2 The Resumption review (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nThis movie is a complete build-up of suspense and thrill keeping you at the edge of your seat. Mohan Lal played the protagonist in this movie. He himself proved again how talented and good an actor he is who is always ahead of everyone in every possible way and he proves it towards the climax just gives you a rush of adrenaline out of the surprising excitement.\r\n\r\nThis film has really uplifted the name “Drishyam” to another level, which was already a mega hit-making way for multiple remakes. If the sequel to a movie fails, then it actually affects the legacy the former had created. But to be frank, there is a huge expectation for every sequel, and this one has really fulfilled everyone\'s expectations.\r\n<h2>So, What\'s about the Interest?</h2>\r\nFrom the start, this movie was very much engaging. Be it the screenplay, the twist here and there, and the ultimate climax which is one of the special elements in Jeethu\'s movie, all we’re so well written and beautifully executed.\r\n\r\nEvery night scenes were literally bringing in that cold feeling within and all the scenes perfectly kept building up the castle, making us wait for the final reveal. There is a line in the movie stating, “ so he has begun his game.” This could have definitely been one of the best theatrical moments, but nevertheless, it was amazing.\r\n\r\nIt was also a family drama and of an ordinary man rising to the occasion.  I think all movie lovers were amazing. The first one hour or so is pretty boring but wait. Hold on to your patience because all these boring moments lead to a massive shocking twist that literally skyrockets the pace of this movie.\r\n<h2>The plot of Drishyam 2</h2>\r\nThe main plot is that in Drishyam,  the police had challenged that they would find the dead body and George Kutty confidently accepted it knowing that they wouldn\'t find it under the police station.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Drishyam 2,  it is revealed that George\'s acts had a witness. since the witness got jailed immediately for his own crime, the investigation did not have a witness. Now 6 years later, the witness is out of jail, and George is in deep trouble when the witness reveals and the dead investigation gets a massive boost.\r\n<h2>Let\'s know a little about Story:</h2>\r\nPart one continues and this sequel shows the routine life of the accused family where Georgekutty becomes a theatre owner from being a cable operator. He writes a book on his own story which he wants to show the same story in a feature film also produced by him. He finds out about the film industry guys and starts working with them. As well as release a book with limited edition copies in only local areas.\r\n\r\nA couple stays just beside their house and the wife accompanies Georgekutty\'s wife as her husband keeps torturing. And there the movie takes all the turn, the couple is shadow police.  And the case is reopened. Varun was killed and her mother is IG And DSPs.\r\n<h3>The personal war Scene</h3>\r\nThere is a scene where he says that it is not about the police department but it is many times about the personal war and this is my war also that how a stupid man can fool the whole police department. How a man can be so much clever and intellectual that he reaches this extent to save his family. The police family comes to know that the dead body is buried under the police station.\r\n\r\nVarun\'s mother and father can become so rebel forgetting the past and their own deeds, as well as they, get one eye witness against Georgekutty. But in this part also, the game by Georgekutty continues and the movie connects the first half and second half strings attached together and shows all dramas.\r\n<h3>The Ultimate End</h3>\r\nThe story ends with a happy ending as the Court releases the full family due to lack of evidence against them. It proves the accused NOT GUILTY. But the how, that is the magic of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeethu_Joseph\" rel=\"nofollow\">JEETU JOSEPH</a> and Drishyam 2.

This movie is <strong>Rohit Shetty\'s</strong> movie. As we all know <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/best-directors-in-bollywood-and-their-successful-movies-of-all-time/\">Rohit Shetty</a> is himself a big name in Bollywood and he has his own fan base. His movies are different from other directors of Bollywood.\r\n\r\nBasically, his movies are mostly based on action. We can see different kinds of action-related drama in his movies. His all previous movies are all commercially successful and always earned a massive box office collection. Though his other movie Suryavanshi is all set to a box office release due to the pandemic second wave in India, the makers also postponed their movie release date for the second time.\r\n\r\nLast year this same incident happened and Rohit Shetty\'s much-awaited movie was not released at theatres for the lockdown declared by the government all over India. The makers and directors did not say anything about when their movie would be released.\r\n<h2>Another Masterpiece after Sooryavanshi and Simmba</h2>\r\nAfter Sooryavanshi, Rohit Shetty started his work for another movie named ‘ Cirkus\'. In this movie, we can see Ranveer Singh sharing the screen with Jacqueline Fernandez and Pooja Hedge as female leads. This movie will be produced by T-series, Reliance Entertainment, and Rohit Shetty\'s production.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6378 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/circus-movie-ranveer-singh-2.jpg\" alt=\"circus movie ranveer singh (2)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nHis last work with Ranveer Singh was Simmba which was a blockbuster and earned massive amounts of money at the box office. After Simmba ‘s success, he decided to work with Ranveer Singh in this movie. As some reports come out about the story in this movie where we can see Ranveer Singh in a double role for the first time. Apart from the lead actor and actress, we can also see Varun Sharma, Siddhartha Yadav, Johnny lever, Mukesh Tiwari in this movie. Deepika Padukone also made a cameo appearance in this movie.\r\n<h2>About The Release Date of Cirkus</h2>\r\nSources said that Cirkus may be released on 31st December in 2021 in the theatre but there is no confirmation by the production house of this movie. Rohit Shetty started the shooting for this movie last November when the cases of Covind decreased day by day all over India.\r\n<h2>The Shooting Time</h2>\r\nAt that time Bollywood filmmakers, directors started to work again with their light camera action. The maximum part of this movie was shot in Mumbai Meheboob studios in Bandra. The shooting started on 16th November 2020 and makers tried to wrap up this movie at the end of February. It is also said that few scenes of this movie may be shot in Goa and Ooty.\r\n\r\nThere was also a rumour that this movie is a remake of the Bollywood old movie Angoor where we can see Mousumi Chatterjee and Sanjeev Kumar sharing the screen in 1982. Though Simmba\'s director denied all this news.\r\n<h2>Based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Shakespeare\'s</a> famous play</h2>\r\nThis movie is actually based on William Shakespeare\'s famous play “The Comedy of Errors”. Ranveer Singh is himself a big name for his acting talent and blockbuster movie. In his career, he tried to portray different shades of character from Ramleela Ram to Padmavat in every space of his movie he proved himself a great versatile actor. For that reason, he is always the director\'s first choice for their movie.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6379 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/circus-movie-ranveer-singh-3.jpg\" alt=\"Cirkus\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nWe can see he already worked with some renowned and promising directors like Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Robot Shetty is also one of them. He already worked with him earlier where he portrayed a police officer character in the movie ‘Simba’. But for the very first time audience will see him portray a double role on screen. It will be challenging for him to portray a double role and how the audience will react to see him on-screen which will be shown when the movie will release.\r\n<h2>Little more About Cirkus Casting</h2>\r\nApart from Ranveer Singh, we can also see Jacqueline Fernandez is also a part of this movie. She is also a big name in her field for her fitness and dancing skill. According to the sources she is one of the busiest actresses in 2021. Apart from Cirkus, she has some big movies in her bucket. some of them she already completed her shooting like Bhoot police, Bachan Pandey and Cirkus.\r\n\r\nVarun Sharma is also a popular face in nowadays big movies. He shared a screen with some big hits like Chichhore, Dilwale, Roohi. where Chichore received the National award for the best movie in Hindi. Where his role was praised by everyone for his comic relief in this movie. His presence in all movies always brings laughter to everyone\'s face.\r\n\r\nPooja Hedge is also seen in this movie to share the screen with Ranveer Singh. It is her first Rohit Shetty movie. She is also in talks of the upcoming movie which has already garnered so much limelight with Telugu superstar and Bahubali famous Prabhas. The name of the movie Pooja and Prabash is Radhe Shaym.\r\n\r\nWe all are eagerly waiting for this movie.

Hence, it deserves to be released on big screens.

However, whatever is evident from the trailer is something like this: A young man gets summoned into an unknown Bangalore where he meets a group of lawyers. The man introduces himself as Karan Oberoi, chief of an advertising agency. He was spending some good time with the lawyer squad. However, truths started unfolding and he found himself trapped in a bizarre game of mock trial where he was accused of being a criminal and now it is his task to prove his innocence.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the question is who is at fault? Are the lawyers really insane and traps innocent people just to pass time? or does Karan have a dark hidden past phone. The possibility of the second option is more as in the flashbacks he was seen with Veer Sahay’s daughter, most probably as her love interest. So, to find answers to these unanswered questions we will have to wait for the film to get released.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Crew of </b><b><i>Chehre</i></b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The direction of this Hindi film has been done by a very reputed Bollywood director named Rumi Jafry.

As we all know how much period films are liked by Indian audiences.\r\n\r\nPeriod movies have another level of excitement not only for their story but the whole set decoration, costume design, VFX, and obviously the look of the characters. If we look at <strong>Sanjay Leela Bhansali\'s</strong> period film there he always tried to stunt the audience by the screen presence of his characters. The same thing happens with <strong>Raja Mauli\'s</strong> <strong>Baahubali</strong>. These two directors always set a mark on period films in Bollywood.\r\n\r\nNow it is time for <strong>Om Raut\'s </strong> <strong>Adipurush</strong>. How he will portray his character of Ram and Sita onscreen is a very big challenge.\r\n<h2><strong><u>The first announcement  of Adipurush:</u></strong></h2>\r\nThe main excitement of <strong>Adipurush</strong> is it\'s one of the lead heroes. In this movie, <strong>Prabhas</strong> will be seen portraying the character of Lord  Ram on screen after the immense success of <strong>Bahubali</strong> and <strong>Bahubali 2.</strong>\r\n\r\nDuring last year\'s lockdown, the Tanhaji director himself came live on Instagram with Prabhas and they declared about making this movie and Prabhas will play the character of Ram in this movie\r\n\r\nIt was great news for Prabash\'s fan who will be seen as a period drama hero after a long time. Om Raut and Prabash took their Instagram account to announce this movie. It was 17 August 2020 when they said an announcement will be revealed on 18 August 2020 at 7:11 am.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CD_jbZhJMv7/?utm_medium=copy_link\r\n\r\nThe next day the team of <strong>\'Adipuruah\'</strong> revealed their first poster of this movie at 7:11 am.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CEAzhvYpVQB/?utm_medium=copy_link\r\n<h2><strong>Adipurush Release date declared:</strong></h2>\r\nAfter the announcement of this high-budget movie, everyone is too excited to know about this movie.

There is so much speculation about this story but some sources said it will be about the battle of Ram and Ravana. For this movie, the VFX team came from outside of India. The team who did VFX in the \'Avatar\' movie will do the VFX for this movie. So it will be exciting to see this movie in the theatre.\r\n<h2><strong><u>The star cast of \'Adipurush:</u></strong></h2>\r\nAs the maker did not reveal much about the movie when they first announced it. At first, the director only said about Prabhas will be playing the role of Rama and for Ravana\'s character, they selected Saif Ali khan. But the others important characters did not reveal at that time.\r\n\r\nFor the role of Sita, many big names come like Deepika Padukone, Anushka Sharma but they finally selected <strong>Kriti Sanon</strong> for the role of goddess Sita. And Sunny Singh for the role of Laxman in this movie. These two characters were revealed this year on March 11.

Not a regular horror movie that will scare you from turning back at night, but its setting, a thread linking myth and fantasy with horror and reality, has the capability of messing up with your mind. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tale that intrigues morality narrates the story of how the characters get cursed (turns into monsters or trees – the most captivating scenes) due to their greed.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A mythological story about Hastar, a greedy deity saved by his creator from other gods only on condition of not being worshipped by anyone forms the backdrop of the film. Problems arise when humans build a temple for him to obtain the wealth he has. With such an out-of-the box storyline, this film will keep your eyes glued to the screen till the end.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Direction, screenplay, cinematography - is indeed the best from many aspects.

Like any other horror story, it starts with a picture-perfect family moving into a new house which is supposedly haunted. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now you will say, what’s new in that plot?

The audience saw her in a glamorous heroine role from her debut film. But she broke this concept when she did \'Barili ki Barfi\' in the year 2017 where she proved herself as a good actor. After that, her most anticipated movie is \'Mimi\' where people will see her as a middle-class girl. Now let\'s see how the audience will react to her new attempt in the acting field.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6647 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/750x600-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"Pankaj tripathi, kriti sanon - Mimi\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n<h2><strong>The release date of the New upcoming movie \'Mimi\':</strong></h2>\r\nThis movie was announced much earlier though but the makers could not release it because of the pandemic situation. As we know that for Covid 19 the theatre was closed from the last year 2020.\r\n\r\nFinally, the makers of this movie decided to release this movie on the web platform. For the last few months, there has been some news of this movie on various online platforms but on 10th July the lead actress of this movie declared the date on which they release their movie through her social media account like Twitter and Instagram.\r\n\r\nThe movie will be streaming from 30th July 2021 this month on Netflix and jio cinema. From that day onwards, audiences will be able to see this movie on these two OTT platforms(Netflix, Amazon prime, <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-10-ullu-web-series-online-that-you-must-watch/\">ullu web series online</a>).  On 6th July the team and the actress shared the first poster of this movie with a caption like Nothing like what you expected.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CRDfSTBrXEf/?utm_medium=copy_link\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CRIo2ZwrW_o/?utm_medium=copy_link\r\n<h2><strong>The movie first announcement:</strong></h2>\r\nThis movie \'Mimi\' was announced much earlier on 30\'th Aug in the year 2019 where the actress Kriti Sanon first shared the movie poster for the first time. This movie\' a story is based on the famous Marathi movie \'Mala Aai Vhhaychy\'.\r\n\r\nThe director of the movie is Lakman Utekar. In this movie both the actress and the director collaborated for the second time after their first one \'lukka chuppi\' was a massive blockbuster at the box office. After announcing this movie Kriti said about her role and her excitement for this movie in her many interactions with the media and audience. She put on an extra 15 kg weight for this role. So, she was working too hard for shaping this role.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B1xmV4kgd9N/?utm_medium=copy_link\r\n<h2><strong>The star cast in the movie:</strong></h2>\r\nAs the movie is a usual story from other commercial Bollywood movies. This is a women-centric movie where you can see a journey of a young girl to become a surrogate mother. Though the concept is different from the story of the other.\r\n\r\nFor this role, the director and maker chose Kriti Sanon as a lead role who becomes a surrogate mother. As for this role the actress has to put extra weight so many stars did not agree to do this kind of role. But Kriti Sanon being a commercial heroine ready to face this challenge in her work field. With her, you can also see versatile actor<a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/pankaj-tripathi-biography-movies-tv-and-awards/\"> Pankaj Tripathi</a>, Supriya Pathak, and Marathi actress Sai Tamhankar.\r\n<h2><strong>The shooting of this movie:</strong></h2>\r\nAs the movie \'Mimi\' was announced earlier in the year 2019.

But few parts remain left so, they completed those parts in Mumbai 2021.\r\n<h2><strong>The Director and producer of the movie \'Mimi\':</strong></h2>\r\n<strong>Lakman Utekar</strong> is the director of this movie. After lukka chuppi, he decided to make this movie under the banner of Maddox production house. His earlier movie was also the same production house and the producer, Dinesh Vijan. So, we can say that after lukka chuppi rocks at the box office. They decided to surprise the audience with something different from a rom-com romantic commercial movie.\r\n\r\nDinesh Vijan is a great producer, in 2018 and 2019 he gave the audience some great movies that will be remembered for a long time.

Now, we have to wait to see how the production house will release the trailer.

Charlie\'s Angels (2019)</b></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><b>IMDb Rating: 4.8</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Director: Elizabeth Banks (Also Directed Pitch Perfect 2)</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Star Cast: Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, Elizabeth Banks, Patrick Stewart, Djimon Hounsou, Sam Claflin, Noah Centineo</b></li>\r\n <li><b>Platform: DIRECTV</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6737 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1Movies-directed-by-Hollywood-Actor-or-Actress.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie\'s Angels (2019)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Charlie’s Angels (2019) is the third movie of this series and probably the worst one. The previous two movies starred </span><b>Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, and <a href=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/top-7-porn-star-turned-actor-actress/\">Cameron Diaz</a></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. And those two movies were quite good. So what went wrong with this one? Well, the plot was crap and so was the acting of the main three leads (especially Kristen Stewart). Though the original soundtrack ‘</span><b>Don’t Call Me Angels’</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> by </span><b>Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Del Rey</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> was a big hit (190M views currently), the movie did not get any good words from the audience or the critics. Sadly, this is one of the worst movies directed by actors.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Elizabeth Banks</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is an American actress whom you may know from </span><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392170/\"><b>Hunger Games </b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Effie Trinket) and </span><b>Pitch Perfect</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (Gail). </span><b>Pitch Perfect 2 </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is the movie that she directed exclusively and that movie was a hit at the box office. </span>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0b0owXWGdo\r\n<h3><b>Fun Facts:</b></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is </span><b>Ella Balinska</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">’s debut feature film as an actress.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><b>19.

You name it. And why would Tom Hanks be left out? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The story of Larry Crowne is very simple and sweet. Larry is a middle-aged man who is only a high school graduate. After an unfortunate turn in his life, he had to get admitted to a college to start anew. There he meets Mercedes, who is his economic teacher in college. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is a romance story between a student and a teacher.

Firstly, at Lucknow, and then in the year 1985, he moved to Punjab and completed his schooling from his hometown. After passing out of 12</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he admitted himself to the Bikram College of Punjab from where he graduated attaining a B.Com degree.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his childhood days, he aspired to join the army. But then, influenced by a cousin, he made his way to Mumbai to try his fate in Bollywood.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Jimmy Shergill family and friends</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shergill was the first in his family to link his name to the Hindi film industry. However, his family is the one to be talked about. He belongs to a royal Punjabi family of elite landowners. Also, he was the niece of the well-known female Indian artist Amrita Shergill.</span>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/COqBwGClGDZ/?utm_medium=copy_link\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>(Jimmy Shergil with his mother)</strong></em></p>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, he is a family man himself and is the father of a boy, Veer. Long back in 2001, he tied the knot with his ladylove Priyanka Puri.</span>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B-__XkQpKug/?utm_medium=copy_link\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>(Shergill with his wife)</strong></em></p>\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CKG0G3iFoIK/?utm_medium=copy_link\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong> (Jimmy Shergill\'s son, Veer Shergill)</strong></em></p>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding friendships, he shares a very good bonding with director Timangshu Dhulia who has himself revealed their best friend in an interview.

You never typecast as a hero or villain and get to play challenging character roles that make people notice you prove your worth as an artist. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub is one such name who has entertained us with versatile roles in numerous movies in all these years. Today let’s get to know a little more about the inspiring journey of the talented actor.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Early life - Biography</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ayyub’s birth and growing up was in the capital city of Delhi. From the nationally reputed educational institution, Kendriya Vidyalaya he completed his school education.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was good in the field of academics which made him get admission to one of the best colleges of Delhi University, the Kirori Mal College. He graduated with flying colours with a Bachelor’s degree in Science. It was during those college days when the love for acting gradually increased in Ayyub.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In KMC he was an active part of the college’s theatre society and participated in countless plays in 3 years. In an interview, the actor jokingly said that thou</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gh he wanted to pursue a B.Sc degree, by the end of college he had been a theatre graduate instead.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5562 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mohammad-Zeeshan-Aayub-biography-2.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His passion took him to the glamorous filmy world with Mumbai post his graduation days. However, reality struck soon when he realized that there was more need to sharpen his acting skills and that he needed to work hard. Ayyub was losing hope but still joined the National School of Drama (NSD) for an acting course. The year was 2006.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub age and physique</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born in 1984, Zeeshan is currently about 37 years old. With a height of about 5’10” and a camera-friendly face, he has the perfect features of an actor.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub family and friends</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actor is from a Muslim family, though reportedly his mom has been a devotee of Hinduism. Ayyub is not the single child of his parents. He has a brother as well as a sister.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the family had no connections with the biggies of the silver screen, both his parents had been reputed theatre artists and had performed in many plays.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding his friends, the actor is very close to actresses like Swara Bhaskar and Sonam Kapoor and even tagg them as ‘best friends’; at least Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub Instagram gave us such glimpses.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5563 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mohammad-Zeeshan-Aayub-biography-3.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub friends\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had also often been seen spending quality time with his co-actors.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5564 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mohammad-Zeeshan-Aayub-biography-4.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammad Zeeshan Aayub biography (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5565 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mohammad-Zeeshan-Aayub-biography-5.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammad Zeeshan Aayub biography (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5566 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thetvfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mohammad-Zeeshan-Aayub-biography-6.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammad Zeeshan Aayub biography (1)\" width=\"750\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Beginning of the journey</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even after completing the acting course at NSD, Aayub didn’t become limelight overnight. That was just the beginning of his struggle. Firstly, as a director in an acting school and then he also worked as an acting teacher in an institute in New York. Finally, it was the year 2011 when stars came in favour of the actor and he got cast in a highly appreciated Hindi film.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub TV shows</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay…so before moving to his Bollywood career, let’s know about his struggling days a little more. As an actor, Ayyub’s journey started with a small screen. In 2008, we saw him in a Doordarshan serial </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiuki Jeena Isika Naam Haai.</span></i>\r\n<h3><strong>Watch Ayyub in an episode from Kyuki Jeena Iska Naam Haai</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLCZXwG5WeE[/embedyt]\r\n<h2>Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub<b> Movies and Reviews</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ayyub’s debut on the big screen was with the ‘inspired from true events’ thriller </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noone Killed Jessica,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where his mind-blowing performance in a negative role had been the show stealer despite the presence of senior actors like Vidya Balan and Rani Mukherjee.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Ayyub’s intense scene from Noone killed Jessica</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peZ7eeMariM[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years, he somewhat got the tag of ‘hero’s best friend or brother’ for getting type cast in such roles in many films including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jannat 2 Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, Zero, Raess, Ranjhaana, Shahid, Tubelight</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, he didn’t pay heed to such stuff and continued to explore various roles in different films. It was his dedicated performances that made him gain appreciation from the audience as well as critics.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Ayyub’s best dialogues from Ranjhaana</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfj3geVE2gs[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, in recent years, the actor has been successful in breaking his stereotypical image by grabbing some significant roles in some movies. These include the antagonistic role of Sadashiv in the historical drama </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; the anti-hero, Nishad of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Article 15</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; the ex-army officer of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mission Mangal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; the biased PTI teacher of the sports drama </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chaalang</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These are, in fact, fall in the category of his most loved performances.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a lead character, Ayyub appeared in the 2017 film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sameer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which failed to gain popularity and since then we had no more seen him portraying the main character in Hindi movies.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>watch Ayyub’s full movie Sameer</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF40WOp-98A[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His other works in Bollywood include </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maazi, Raja Natwarlal, Dolly Ki Doli, Phantom, Tanu weds Manu and its sequel, All is Well.</span></i>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">watch what Zeeshan said regarding working with the 3 Khans of Bollywood</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7A9ToTEKQA[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now fans are waiting to see him in the upcoming film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atrangi Re</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> along with actors like Akshay Kumar and Dhanush.</span>\r\n<h2>Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub<b> web series</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OTTs proved to be the safest place, giving this extremely talented actor his deserved recognition as a protagonist. He made his web series debut last year with the SonyLiv original, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Simple Murder</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He played the character of a struggling entrepreneur trying to rise in the eyes of his wife whom he loves a lot.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">watch how a well-known YouTube channel praised Ayyub’s A Simple Murder</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-4xhf0y_Xw[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same year, he rose to more fame by playing the controversial character of Shiva Shekhar in the Amazon Prime political thriller series, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taandav.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Haters tried to point out how the actor tried to show Hindu Gods in a bad light. Ignoring all of that, if we focus on the portrayal of his character, as viewers we will understand how multifaceted Ayyub is as an actor.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Watch Ayyub as Shiva from Tandav</strong></h3>\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1Ae5xUZATo[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Other works</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We saw Zeeshan in a very heart-touching advertisement for OYO rooms. Every one of you must see it to move to tears.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ayyub’s OYO commercial</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZf3sekxQio[/embedyt]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had also been part of a short film – </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guess Pyar Se</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ayyub’s short film – Guess Pyar Se</span>\r\n\r\n[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWZIAE7mWoU[/embedyt]\r\n<h2><b>Achievements</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All through his career, Ayyub had been successful in becoming one of the most appreciated actors. But it’s really sad that a talented gem like him had not received a single award for any of his memorable performances. For </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No One Killed Jessica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he gained 2 nominations. For his comic role in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranjhaana</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also he was nominated twice but won none, unfortunately.</span>\r\n<h2>Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub <b>Relationship status</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heartbreaking to know that this handsome talented actor is not at all single! Okay, jokes apart, he fell in love with TV actress Rasika Agashe in 2006-07. They both were enrolled in NSD to learn acting and most probably it is where their story began. Soon, in 2007, even before Ayyub made his Bollywood debut, the couple tied the knot. For the last almost 14 years they are leading a successful, happy married life. They are often together, spending time with each other despite their busy schedules.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In 2015 they were blessed with a sweet daughter whom they named Raahi.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year when #BoycottTanishq became trending and was accused of promoting love Jihad in an advertisement, Agashe was one of those who bravely raised her voice against the wrong. She shared her baby shower pictures on her social media handle and expressed her opinions regarding how the public should be aware of the Special Marriage Act. After all, it’s all about love when it comes to marriage and the Zeeshan-Agashe duo has proved it. They look really adorable with each other.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rashika Agashe shared her Baby Shower picture to voice against #BoycottTanishq</span>\r\n<h2>Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub net worth - $1-$5 Million</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of 2020, the actor had a net worth of $1-$5 Million.</span>\r\n<h2><b>The Political is personal!</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zeeshan had always been one of those actors involving himself and voicing strong opinions against any political wrong or such scenarios – be it CAA protests, the arrest of JNU activist Umar Khalid or even the most recent farmers’ protest. He had even joined the farmers in their protest at the Singhu border and supported them.</span>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CIqM374JF-1/?igshid=12yvpenq70zii\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/B791qdXJEEW/?igshid=1vfuw3fcjhe7y\r\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is high time when talents like Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub must not get wasted in Bollywood. He has proved his capability many times and deserves to be a lot more than what he is today. Ayyub has the potential of being a leading Bollywood actor and hence we wish him all the luck for his future endeavors.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Finally, this is our content for today.
